            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE PRINCE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I conſider (Greateſt of Princes and my moſt gracious Prince) that all men which paſſe their dayes in this World, with looſe and vntyed Endes; (neither binding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, their Countries Profit, nor their owne particular aduancement) doe but wander and goe aſtray like wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Trauellers loſt on ſome wilde and vntract wildernes, and cannot be ſaid to Iourney but to Toyle. And when J ſee that an idle man is nothing elſe but the Deuils cuſhion, on which wickednes ſits, whileſt Sloath ſleepes on his boſome, I could not then chuſe but rouze vp my ſpirits to vndertake ſome labour, which might both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer me from this errour, and (by calling backe the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my firſt times) ſhew that there is ſomething in me in the preſent which with a conſtant faithfulnes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to doe your Higneſſe and my Countrey ſeruice.</p>
            <p>Warre (gracious Sir) hath been euer my Miſtreſſe, and though I could not get ſo neere her as J wiſht, yet I haue euer loued her as J ought: and though I haue not been worthy to participate with her Glory, yet ſhe hath been pleaſed to daigne me her bloody fauours, and to fixe them ſo ſure, that (whilst I am) the Scarres will neuer part from my body. Hence it comes, that I bring this<pb facs="tcp:14641:3"/>ſacrifice to her Altar, and only deſire I may offer it vp before your Goodnes, making you (as you are) the great Captaine of this honourable Band, which howſoeuer I heere haue rankt their Names, yet doubtleſſe in their hearts wil continually be a noble emulation who ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch you nearest in the feruencie of true Loue, or the height of a worthie Admiration. The Subiect (though peraduenture darkned by my blunt Language) is worthy your most Princely attention: for <hi>Warre</hi> is onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Princes, ſince they (and none but they) may (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God) defend their owne by the Sword, relieue their oppreſſed neighbours with the Sword, cut downe all tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous and rebellious weeds vnder the Sword: and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, acquire great Conqueſts, &amp; enioy true Fame through the Sword; for indeed but they for themſelues, and others by their Authoritie, none elſe may draw the Sword.</p>
            <p>Jt is true (mightie Sir) that your thrice worthy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my dread Soueraigne hath ſheathed his Sword, and by his ſacred Wiſedome ſaued the blood of many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, all his leuels (as by his owne vnimitable pen is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted) are at true Pietie, and God which is beſt pleaſed with Peace, hath crownd his daies with ſuch Peace, that Warre could not bring any of his progenitors the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to his glory: his Peace and Patience (in the dayes of our admired <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) made his paſſage ſmooth &amp; eaſie to his lawfull Inheritance, &amp; he entred the Throne with ſuch an vniuerſall Ioy, and applauſe of his people, that the admiring
<hi>French</hi> cried out in amazement, <hi>What without a Blow, O wonder!</hi> But this was God, and by him hath his Maieſtie ſhut vp euery backe
<pb facs="tcp:14641:3"/>dore that could let in Diuiſion: yet how long this Peace ſhall continue God in his wiſdome (not man) is able to reckon. I know though
<hi>Licurgus</hi> made his Laws conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by <hi>War,</hi> yet <hi>Numa</hi> made his more happy by <hi>Peace,</hi> &amp; though the firſt may indure yet the later ſhalbe more eternall, and both of neceſsitie muſt ſtill lodge neere to remembrance. It was <hi>Ioſephs</hi> counſel, In plentie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for dearth, and in peaceable times to ſecure Armes is no needles conſideration. It is not doubted but a wiſe Prince may gouern the worlde with an Oliue Branch (for ſo did the <hi>Romans</hi>) yet when the ſword comes, the bough muſt yeld; for the leafe can but perſwade, tis the Steele which muſt enforce, and where both are vnited, there euer is Tranquility moſt faire &amp; moſt flouriſhing; Your Highnes is an Heire of many kingdoms, and may iuſtly haue occaſion to command many ſwords, either to recouer your right in forain parts, or relieue your frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds in other parts; and though we inioy the ſweetneſſe of Peace, and pray continually for the preſeruation of the ſame peace, yet muſt not Warre be made altogether a ſtranger: but as it is ſaid of Death, <hi>To prepare for it, giues no approach vnto it:</hi> ſo to prepare &amp; be ready at all times for war, is no froſt that can nip the pleaſant bloſſoms of peace, for both are the handmaids of Kings, the one beares his Commandements, the other his Loue, the one makes him powerfull amongſt his neighbors, the other rich amongſt his owne people: So that taking the true poize of this Subiect, to whom can J better offer this Tribute, then to your gracious ſelfe (not as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to your knowledge (farre be ſuch arrogance) but as an Aduocate to plead my dutie) in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all perfections<pb facs="tcp:14641:4"/>flow to ſo entire an excellence, that Art and Nature haue left in themſelues no power to promiſe any thing beyond you: Be therefore (Gracious Sir) pleaſed to protect this poore endeauour of your plaine Souldier, and how euer it comes (like Truth) naked into the world, yet let it finde ſhelter in the Shadow of your Royall Countenance; Firſt in reſpect you are the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Heire of my dread King, and ſo J your vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall owe you all my Goodnes; next, in regard
<hi>Warre</hi> is my ſubiect, whoſe Triumphs J hope ſhall euermore attend you; and laſty, for your owne deare vertues ſake which is the Foode, Life and Soule of euery Souldier. To this and only this great Senate of your diuine perfections J humbly ſubmit my Labours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching the God of Heauen and Earth to bleſſe your Highneſſe with all true and perfect happines to the Glory of his greate name, the good of his Church, and the vnſpeakeable Comfort of the King, and vs that are his People.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Orkes of this Nature (in different Sir what euer you bee) as they are not without many difficulties, ſo they ſeldome or neuer paſſe without many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Cenſures, and thoſe alwayes led according to the Opinions of ſuch as gouerne them; ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of mercifull
<hi>Interpretation,</hi> ſome of ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Pittie,</hi> and ſome of
<hi>Seueritie,</hi> which it is no Iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to call <hi>Tyranny.</hi> Any or all which ſince I haue made my ſelfe liable vnto them by this Publication, blame mee not if I ſeeke to reduce them to their nobleſt and beſt Countenances by my iuſt and vnfained excuſes.</p>
            <p>It is true that I neuer had a daring to thinke there was an abſolute perfection in any of my labours; for I knew mine owne Strength, and the many <hi>Precipices,</hi> which lay before mee, into ſome of which I muſt neceſſarily fall, though not through the rudeneſſe of
<hi>Ignorance,</hi> yet for ſome eſpeciall ends to which I had tyed my ſelfe almoſt by a Legall condition: and therefore hauing no refuge but this PREFACE, let mee be held excuſable, if I make it yeeld Reaſons for ſuch eſcapes, as thoſe which are not familiar with my Boſome, may take for
<hi>Miſtakings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of theſe the firſt which I thinke will bee called vnto memory, is ſome Miſplacings or Errours in my Raunge, as namely, the omiſſion of that Noble and Vertuous Lady, the Lady <hi>Diſpenſer,</hi> who although ſhee may truely challenge the firſt place in this Roll of Nobilitie, and that both her owne Goodneſſe, and her Sonnes moſt noble parts, together with a ſtrong Bond of Blood by which I am bound, ties mee rather to hunt and finde out any thing that might adde to their Greatneſſe, then loſe or let paſſe the leaſt tittle belonging to their true Honour; yet in as much as the tenderneſſe of her ſexe, and the vnfit proportions which are betwixt her and a Subiect of this harſh, rough, and vnpleaſant nature, tels me how vnproper ſuch applications haue euer beene held both in all times paſt, and in theſe which are now preſent amongſt vs, I could not but imagine ſuch an omiſſion rather an ornament to Order, then an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of any due which is proper to vertue.</p>
            <p>Next this, the Raunging of the Earle of CASTLE-HAVEN, the
<pb facs="tcp:14641:5"/>Viſcounts of COLCHESTER and ROCHFORD, as alſo the two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heires of WORCESTER and SVFFOLKE, may draw on ſome curious exception, becauſe I haue rankt them but as <hi>Barons,</hi> and as they ſit in Parliament, whereas their places containe an higher eſtimation. To theſe exceptions I haue Appologiz'd in the Proems of their Epiſtles; but for a further ſatisfaction: true it is, that theſe Epiſtles (though but now publiſhed) yet were written long before, and at ſuch time as the Range was proper (to moſt of them) without any ſerious exception. Beſides, I muſt confeſſe I haue written another <hi>Semi Centurie</hi> of Epiſtles appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning onely to <hi>Honour,</hi> which I conſecrate to the greater Nobilitie, and in them already haue ranged the Greateſt; therefore to haue omitted theſe (being men of ſuch noble worth and antiquitie) how euer mine errour now be pardonable, it had then beene paſt excuſe. Hence it is, I haue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made choice to bee too bold with ſome, then to neglect others, and howſoeuer in ſome places I may bee thought to skip or take too large ſtrides, leaping ouer ſome, to attaine others, yet it is neither partialitie, nor ſingularity in affection; but rather a compeld Method which I muſt purſue out of the dutie I owe to the greatneſſe of
<hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, hauing confined my ſelfe to the true proportion of <hi>Decads,</hi> &amp; thoſe <hi>Decads</hi> iumping into a iuſt <hi>Semi-Centurie</hi> of Epiſtles, whoſe number is fiftie two and no more, I muſt either breake the whole frame of mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Building, or elſe leaue ſome names to an after-remembrance, at which if any repine, ſaying mine owne libertie might haue beſtowed on mee a limit of more largeneſſe: to that I muſt ingeniouſly confeſſe, that howſoeuer I might haue aſſumed more labour, yet I could haue hardly (in this ſubiect) found out more fit matter: for hauing made my Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as high as the <hi>Generall,</hi> it was not in me to ſeeke to aſcend aboue it, leaſt ſtepping but one haires breadth beyond my knowledge, I might ſo haue fallen backe with diſgrace, and ruin'd my whole labour.</p>
            <p>Some peraduenture (yet but the ignorant) may condemne, or at leaſt queſtion why I elected this manner of writing in <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> rather then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Formes,</hi> which are now more frequent amongſt vs, to which I anſwere, That I tooke this way for the moſt ancient, beſt, and nobleſt Preſident: and hauing in my ſelfe a freedome of choyce, I held that <hi>Ambition,</hi> an honeſt and praiſe-worthy <hi>Deſire,</hi> which conducted mee to follow thoſe Steps which ſo many renowned and famous men haue not onely purſued, but alſo left vnto the world as a rule worthy our Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: for thus in Epiſtles write many of the excellenteſt Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, as <hi>Tullie, Seneca,</hi> and a world of others: Thus writ the beſt Poets, as <hi>Ouid, Horace, Martiall,</hi> and the like: thus haue Kings writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as <hi>Dionyſius:</hi> thus haue Emperours written, as
<hi>Aurelius:</hi> thus haue Popes written, thus haue Biſhops; nay, thus haue the ſacred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church written: and thus haue writ the moſt bleſſed <hi>Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, (for euery ſmall Moate appeares a Beame to the eye of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie) ſome may except againſt ſome little litterall, and indeed no<pb facs="tcp:14641:5"/>faults eſcaped in the Printing: to which I can but ſay, that if our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (which queſtionleſſe is now as perfect, as ſignificant, and as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as any other) ſtood vpon its owne ground-worke without the Baſes of other <hi>Dialects,</hi> then there might bee one ready, certaine, and high way in which to walke and finde out true
<hi>Orthographie,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> will challenge multiplicitie of Letters, the <hi>Italian</hi> gloriouſneſſe in ſound, the
<hi>Dutch</hi> a filling of the mouth, the <hi>Latine</hi> his puritie, and the
<hi>Greeke</hi> his myſterie: ſo that indeed to ſatiſfie all, is more then many mens labours; and I muſt begge, if any ſmall eſcapes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to encounter with your eye-ſight, let a fauourable mercy cure it, and I ſhall not onely be thankfull, but praiſe a nature which is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſo honeſt a patience.</p>

               <head>THE ARGVMENT. <hi>The Motiues to this Worke.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen (my good Lord) I intended this worke, and had fixt with my ſelfe a reſolution to range in this Battalion, the noble Troupe of all our ſurui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Engliſh Barons, in ſuch ſort as I had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeene in ſome other Preſidents; Mee thought the leading of the Right hand
<hi>File</hi> did properly poynt at your Lordſhip, both in reſpect the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect is much too rough and vnpleaſant for the well tuned eares of fearefull and modeſt Ladies, as alſo that the clangor and ſhrill noiſe of the trumpet and drumme, are rather full of affright then pleaſure, &amp; do ſooner aſtoniſh then delight the tender ſoftnes of a ſweet Ladie: ſo that vnder your Lordſhips name I muſt couer both your kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman and your owne greatneſſe; and to you in this Epiſtle giue a briefe account of thoſe eſpeciall Motiues which haue ſtirred me vp to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and performe this labour, in ſuch ſort as it is heere (though bluntly and plainly) yet with all truth and care faithfully effected.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſſe, I neither expect nor wiſh for greater priuiledge then others haue found which haue runne before me in Tracts of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but euer ſtand ready to receiue the Battery of Cenſure and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, onely from the daring ignorant, pray heartily for ſome helpe and aſſiſtance; for they neuer hold faire quarter, but ſtill carrie poyſon in their weapons, whereas Iudgement and Learning are euer noble and like <hi>Achilles,</hi> if they hurt yet cure againe in the ſame inſtant. Me thinks I heare one queſtion how a man vnlearned, and hauing ſpent ſo long a time in the warres, could find leaſure to arme himſelfe for others inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or how where few or no Bookes are, yet Bookes ſhould thus bee daily created; another obiects, how I (hauing attained no greater place than the Title of priuate Captaine) can finde out Rules by which to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14641:7"/>and gouerne more publique and powerfull Officers, and the laſt (though not the leaſt in the bundle of Envie) demands how I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this Trade of making Booke-Souldiors, as if the Arte of Warre were not better attain'd by Practiſe than Contemplation; to all which I muſt returne this one ioynt and entire anſwere; firſt, it is not vnknown to thoſe which beſt know me, that I was euer a louer of the Muſes, and as I ſpent my Summer Progreſſe in the warres, ſo I conſumed my Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters quiet in the wholſome delights of forraine Accademies; and if I be any way ſhort in Scholler-like perfection, queſtionleſſe the defect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds much rather from mine owne dulneſſe, than deſire to reſt at that point which might in ſome ſort expreſſe me a Scholler. Thirtie and odde yeares I haue ſpent abroad in theſe imployments; and ſure the Prenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is ſo ſufficient, that a very dull Mechannick might in that ſpace haue writ himſelfe Maſter of his occupation, and the greateſt trewant (much ſooner a willing mind) might without wonder in that time attaine to the higheſt degree in the graueſt Studie: and queſtionleſſe this I muſt ſay for the Warres, that euen in Gariſons and Campes, I haue profited more by conference with noble Spirits, than by any priuat Meditation, though pen'd with the greateſt luſter: ſo that ioyning together Practiſe and Obſeruation, had I been duller then Malice could wiſh me, yet I could not but haue made much vſe of my deſeruings, and finding it <hi>Honeſtum, Vtile, Delectabile,</hi> how could mine Admiration chuſe but ſtill ſearch to find out the perfection? For this <hi>Ne Sutor vltra,</hi> I haue ſeene ſo many vndertakings (of men which neuer ſaw the Warres) paſſe with that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe and reuerence, that I imagined, although my Suruey was neuer ſo little, yet I might more freely labour in this worke, and make mine expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of greater force, both for mine owne knowledge, and others ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Againe, howſoeuer my Fortune hath ſtaid in the middle way or halfe path to Greatnes, yet hath both my Blood and it made me worthy to commerce and confer with great perſons, and to obſerue the greateſt Actions: ſo that marrying to mine owne Readings the manage of their approued wiſdomes, I could not be ſo weakly fortified, as to make doubt of mine owne ſtrength, or to ſuppoſe it is not able to beare me a much higher pitch than at this time mine Ambition will giue me leaue to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume. Laſtly, for the title of a <hi>Booke-Souldier</hi> (than which there is not a more diſtaſtfull ſound to the eare of a military Profeſſour) I confeſſe a meere <hi>Phormio</hi> is vnfit to tutor
<hi>Hanibal,</hi> and a meere <hi>Aiax</hi> (which hath nothing but his anger) is leſſe fit then <hi>Vliſſes</hi> to weare <hi>Achilles</hi> armour; but there muſt euer bee ſuch a perfit mixture in the compoſition which is made between them, that the Souldier muſt neuer be without one cup of the Muſes <hi>Nepenthe,</hi> nor the Scholler ſo vnnimble, but that at any command he may be able to dance a <hi>Lauolta</hi> to the tune of the Cannon,
<hi>Caeſar</hi> muſt be able to write his Commentaries, and <hi>Tullie</hi> know how to put on his Armor when <hi>Rome</hi> is ready to be fired.</p>
               <p>That the Subiect it ſelfe muſt lie at the mercy of Cenſure, the very Times doe allow it: for <hi>Peace</hi> hath made vp her garland with ſuch ſweet<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14641:7"/>Flowers, that the bitternes of
<hi>Lawrell</hi> is not to bee diſgeſted, and euery one can ſay to his companion, Take downe your harps againe, and hang vp your Armes on the willowes: breake no ſleeps with your drums, nor let the barbed Steed either ſpurne the earth, or chide the bit which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraines him: let Souldiers now turne Tradeſmen; for <hi>Minerua</hi> hath caſt away her lance, &amp; the Booke of the ſeuen Arts is become both her play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and pillow. Is not
<hi>Ianus</hi> temple now cloſed, and yet ſhall <hi>Warre</hi> ſpeake loud to affright vs? hath not this land been harrowed many yeres with
<hi>Romans, Saxons, Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans?</hi> haue not our ſelues within our ſelues in the Barons wars, and in the mightie diuiſions of
<hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canſter</hi> ſpent blood enough? hath not the iniuries of <hi>France,</hi> the reuenge of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the falſhood of <hi>Ireland</hi> opened wounds enough, but that now when God hath ſent vs a peaceable Prince, a hopefull Iſſue, happie Vnion, and a generall calmeneſſe with all that dwell farre or neere about vs, ſhall we now ſing of warre, or let the ſound of the drumme thunder amazement amongſt vs? O no tis a labour needleſſe, and a ſeruice thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. Well, all this I confeſſe, and more then this will ſolemnly affirme, that
<hi>Peace</hi> is the ſweeteſt tune which euer warbled in a Chriſtians eare, euen ſacred from heauen: for it is ſaid, <hi>I will leaue my Peace with you;</hi> moſt deſired of good men, and ſuch a bleſſing to vs that enioy it, as ſearching amongſt all the Treaſures both of heauen and earth, none is found to mankind more deare or precious; ſo that we are infinitly bound to praiſe God, and pray for the King, by whoſe mercy and wiſedome wee haue found ſo gracious a poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>But becauſe <hi>Peace</hi> is to be deſired, ſhall
<hi>Warre</hi> bee vtterly neglected; becauſe we enioy the ſweet taſte of Tranquilitie, ſhall we caſt away the wholeſome bitterneſſe of
<hi>Warre,</hi> or becauſe the Summer quarter hangs vpon vs, ſhall we thinke Winter will rot on the Skie, and ſtand in need of no prouiſion, God forbid: the world and her proiects tels vs the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; nay, the Sauiour of the world hath propheſied to the contrary, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that <hi>At the end of the world there ſhall bee warres and rumours of warres,</hi> and therefore howſoeuer we are now bleſt with an hauenly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Peace, yet we are but Tenants at will, and theſe ſecure times beſt fit martiall meditations. Warre is the teeming mother, and doth in as much abundance bring foorth Souldiers, as Peace doth decay them; and queſtionleſſe ſince both are alike incertaine to our apprehenſions, it is needfull we be equally prouided for eithers entertainment, and to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that as Pietie, Pouertie, Humilitie, Loue and Vnitie breed Peace, ſo from her may deſcend Plentie, Pride, Contempt and Diſcord, the foſter children of Warre and Diſtemper: for there muſt euer be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes and changes amongſt men which are mortall: ſo that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, In theſe quiet times there cannot be a more neceſſary watch-word than <hi>Arma virum<expan>

Theſe conſiderations haue
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14641:8"/>ſet an edge on my deſires, and ſo fortified my Reſolution, that it is not able to ſinke vnder any other perſwaſion, or if it would, yet are there many other inducements and motiues, which would ſtill keepe life in my firſt opinion, as my dutie to God, my ſeruice to my Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and mine endeared affection to my priuat friends and companions, to all which as I am bound by ſeuerall engagements; ſo to them all I muſt giue ſeuerall accounts of the ſeuerall rights, their merits and worthes may truly challenge from me. God himſelfe hath profeſſed an exacting the account of Talents, and that ſtrictly; My Prince (by whoſe ſacred prouidence we enioy our tranquilitie, euery man reſting vnder his owne Vine in ſafetie, and feeding on his Fig-tree with delight and pleaſure) will expect that we (in our lower callings) ſhew both obedience and will to preſerue the Peace his wiſdome hath planted; my Countrey from her Natiues cannot demand a leſſe rent than their endeauors; and my friends to whom I am bound for ciuill commercement, muſt either taſte the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of my wel-taken paines, or hold me ingratefull. Theſe are the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues which haue fixt me to this labour, and hence I haue aſſumed this Method of writing theſe ſhort Eſſayes or Epiſtles, being a forme both exact and ancient, found out by the graueſt Fathers, followed by the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Orators, allowed by all Moderne Writers, and left as a Preſident vnto vs by the beſt Authours: So that being clenſed both from Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and oſtentation, hauing in it a generall profit, and a particular end to goodneſſe, being all mens ayme, all mens aduancement; I doubt not but it will appeare faire to your Lordſhip and to your noble Ranke, hauing this Maxime ſtill to keepe my hope in ſafetie, that <hi>Bonum eſt quod omnes appetunt.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Goe not about (my Lord) in this Epiſtle, either to awake your courage, or inſtruct your knowledge, but rather to recount vnto you thoſe Rules and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to which both your owne and your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors actions may giue moſt true and liuely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: Therefore howſoeuer I ſhall be forced like the Dogs on the bankes of <hi>Nylus</hi> to feed running and but catch heere and there at theſe dangerous waters, yet if your Lordſhip ſhall be pleaſd to take them to a conſtant conſideration, I doubt not but they ſhal deliuer you matter worthy both of your delight and ſtudie.</p>
               <p>It is true, that in my former Epiſtle I haue ſleightly pointed at the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary care which belongs to this military Art, euen in the quieteſt and moſt ſecured times. It behoues me now to ſhew the neceſſitie both of the Art and thing it ſelfe not only at other times, but all times, for it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion <hi>Sine qua non,</hi> and is as old as the world: for as <hi>Perfection</hi> entred, <hi>Flattery</hi> followed, and <hi>Force</hi> draue both out of that bleſſed habitation. When the world was ſo poore, that it had but three men only, yet one of them then ſlew his brother, and as the world grew riper, ſo force increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and (as ſome of the firſt <hi>Rabbins</hi> affirme) ambitious <hi>Lamech</hi> ſlew his grandſire <hi>Cain</hi> with an arrow, which was euer accounted a military wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon: and although this proue not a lawfull neceſſitie, yet it infers that when the ſword is in the hand of a wicked poſſeſſor, then violence and outrage follow and purſue one another, till noble
<hi>Warre,</hi> and his beſt friend <hi>Fortitude</hi> either reſtraine their furie, or puniſh their treſpaſſe: for this is warre needfull, and hence it comes that the ruling Sword ought euer to be ſwayd by Iuſtice arme, for it is the power of the Law which<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14641:9"/>doth reaſon to all men, and the meaſure of Right which ſhares out things by a iuſt and equall proportion. I confeſſe it were a note of excellent modeſtie, if (as <hi>Tullie</hi> perſwaded) the Sword would giue place to the Gowne, and it might well be aſſumed, as greater Hoſtes (in their owne houſes) giue precedency to meaner Gueſts, or as we ſay of doating pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that they are content to be made Fooles by the wit of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But to aſcribe it as a due or right, is not right: for the Gowne can but meditate and ſay,

               <p>It is not to be argued but a meere Scholler deſerues much better then a meere Souldier, in as much as the head is a wealthier member than the Arme, but the compounded man which conſiſteth of equall and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parts, is farre aboue them both; for hee ſees and doth, knowes and can execute; An head armeleſſe, or an Arme headleſſe, makes but vp a lame Commander; <hi>Iſadas</hi> raſhneſſe finds ſhame inſtead of Laurell, and <hi>Xerxes</hi> Cowardiſe (though it know how to cloath the Ocean with Shippes) runnes from the <hi>Perſians</hi> with reproach and diſhonor; It is true that the Orators in <hi>Rome</hi> (by the name of
<hi>Senators</hi>) did long time ſway that Infinite Empire, giuing Lawes to
<hi>Peace,</hi> and Rules to <hi>Warre,</hi> Kings gouern'd as they commanded, and Generalls fought as they directed. But when <hi>Caeſar</hi> returned to
<hi>Rome,</hi> and was adorned both with knowledg and action, who then durſt withſtand him? nay though he affected the Diadem, (an ambition of all others moſt hatefull to their natures) yet who but obeyed him? did <hi>Brutus?</hi> did <hi>Caſsius?</hi> did <hi>Tullie?</hi> did <hi>Cato?</hi> did any in the large Beadrole of his fatall Conſpirators, by eloquence reclaime him? no, twas with Ponyards, force euermore muſt maſter force, and it is the violent ſtroke of one nayle which euermore muſt driue out the other,
<hi>Caeſar</hi> was a Cedar, not a Willow, he that would bring him downe muſt lay the Axe to his roote, not bend his toppe with an Engine; It is certaine the <hi>Romans</hi> vs'd all the art of practiſe, all ſecreſie in Treaſon, and all the ſhame in Libells; they had cunning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to let the people know <hi>Caeſars</hi> faults and their owne loſſes, they could put <hi>Freedome</hi> in his beſt Garments, and make <hi>Profit</hi> appeare as gloryous as an Angell, yet all was but as duſt ſcattered in the winde, and t'was only the Stabbe, and nothing but it alone that preuailed, To deſcend nearer to our owne familiar knowledge, what <hi>Senator</hi> is there which euer liued, or what Orator that euer pleaded, who giuing Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on a delinquent, could by force of his eloquence perſwade the wretch to runne himſelfe to the Gallowes, put on the nooſe and leape from the Ladder with
<hi>Dulce quia ſponte,</hi> no; life is a dearer companion to mans nature, and when that is forfeit, the Sherife (which is his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Souldior) muſt with his armed Band, compell him to the bloody Altar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as in this, ſo in all caſes whatſoeuer, that are allied to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, whether it be the execution of writs, obedience to lawes, the ſetling of Eſtates and Manners; where the conſcience will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, there the Sword muſt enforce and vſe his commandement;<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14641:9"/>Should forraine enemies vpon falſe ſuggeſted Titles inuad vs, our ſwords (vnder God) muſt defend vs? ſhould our Soueraignes looſe any part of their lawfull Rights, our Swords are bound to regaine them? ſhould Traytors like
<hi>Hydras,</hi> increaſe by killing, yet muſt the Sword ſuppreſſe them? ſhould Rebells ſpring like the growth of the Dragons teeth, yet muſt the Sword conſume them? and ſhould our Neighbours or allies be oppreſt, or true religion ſuppreſt, yet muſt our Swords maintaine them? ſo that we may conclude in all caſes whatſoeuer, whether <hi>Fas</hi> or
<hi>Nefas,</hi> either to ſtrengthen Iuſtice, or weaken iniury, to guard
<hi>Vertue,</hi> or to combate <hi>Vice:</hi> yet there is a ſtrong neceſſity why the Sword ſhould ſtill be required.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore giue the Sword his due, and ſay it is the eldeſt ſonne of <hi>Honor,</hi> and let vs giue that Royall Commander his deſerued admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who though he haue ſheathed his owne, and almoſt all the Swords in Chriſtendome, yet ſtill ſtands fortified with ſo powerfull a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that with them of <hi>Colen,</hi> the whole world may cry out, it is a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to thinke to reſiſt a Prince ſo good, ſo wiſe, and ſo fortunate; <hi>War</hi> neuer had ſo many Schooles in the time of Troubles, as his Peace hath <hi>Academies</hi> to expreſſe the depth of Martiall diſcipline; euery man now is more then a maſter in that braue Art, and Infants and Children as they are going to the ſchoole, can teach one another the vſe of Weapon, March, Motion and Poſture; ſo that ſtrangers and forraine Nations haue beene heard to ſay, <hi>What will the Engliſh doe? if this continue, euery child like Hercules will be able to kill a Serpent in his Cradle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed againe to the neceſſity of this deſigne, and to ſhew that Peace ſhould be nothing elſe but a foſter Nurſe vnto Souldiers, take a Suruey of all Gouernments, whether <hi>Aſsirians, Perſians, Greekes</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi> and we ſhall ſee that the Peace which they enioyed at home, euer brought them forth thoſe Souldiers which conquered abroad, for Warre is a deuourer, and only deſires action, giues little leaſure to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Or to come a little nearer to our ſelues, let vs looke into the deeds of great <hi>Henry</hi> of France, and we ſhall ſee that though the <hi>Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> had in fiue and twenty yeares ſeene foure mightie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations yet was the laſt (which had inioyd the longeſt peace) the greateſt and moſt tranſendent, being (as the Duke of <hi>Suylly</hi> reported) of that infinite ſpace and largeneſſe, that the firſt day it was knit together, it ſeemed both to promiſe victory, and to ſing the triumph, and the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was ſo great, that it ſtroke Ielouſie into all the Kings friends, and feare amongſt his enemies, for the Sword was drawne that might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but no man knew to whome it would ſpeake; power and valour, like thunder in the hand of
<hi>Iupiter,</hi> was ready to fall in a twinckling, yet was no enemy ſeene, no peace broken, no warre proclaimed. This was the ability of a right peace, and by theſe helpefull prouiſions, he became both feared, beloued and admired: what ſhall we ſay of the peace in the Netherlands, but that euery day it hath almoſt begot them a new army, and euery night intic'd to the Seas an inuincible Nauy; So that through<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14641:10"/>prouidence they are becommed ſo infinitely rich, both in the one and the other prouiſion, that of them may be ſaid, as was ſaid of the Secular Triumphs, <hi>Come and ſee that which was neuer ſeene, and which no man liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euer thought to ſee;</hi> a Nation that ſtood in need of all, now needed of all, and ſhe that was taught of all, now teaching all others; this wonder hath peace wrought, and this profit haue they gaind by exerciſing peace with a hurtleſſe Matiall imployment; I could inferre as much for <hi>Spaine,</hi> and ſay that her peace at home, bred her Souldiers to guard her gettings abroad, and that neither the vnwholeſomneſſe of the Equinoctiall line, nor the vninhabited Tropycks (ſo much feared of our forefathers) hath had ſo much power to conſume men; as martiall diſcipline (in times of calmneſſe) hath had ſtrength to reuiue them, and like the beſt Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to make infinites grow from a ſingle ſeede or proiection.</p>
               <p>To conclude then, (for the neceſſity of <hi>Warre</hi> was neuer accounted a Paradox) Armes and Soulderie are the Cronicles of Princes, the hazards of Battayles their Theaters, and the Iuſtice of their warlike cauſe their Honor, Perfection and Tryumph; ſo that he which will liue long in mens memory, muſt build this <hi>Pyramed</hi> whereon his name muſt ſtand, ſtrong, vpright and euen; he that will fill his Theater with ſhouts and plaudyties, muſt grapple with <hi>Lyons</hi> and
<hi>Tygers,</hi> and he that will tryumph in perfection, muſt haue all the foure vertues chaynd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not to his Charyot, ſo ſhall his armes bee lawfull and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and howſoeuer the curious may account him a meane Captaine, yet ſhall not the whole world produce the Character of a better, a more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or a more renowned Souldior.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince in the Time paſt we haue no intereſt at all, and in that of the preſent we can challenge no more but an Inſtant, how behouefull is it (noble Sir) for euery man to bee carefull to what ends his Imployments ayme, that the expence thereof may returne both an acceptable rent to ſuch as may challenge his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and alſo ſome glory to himſelfe, by leauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thoſe parcels which may giue others cauſe of honeſt Imitation. This (my Lord) hath directed me into this path which now (with all earneſtneſſe) I follow, and this emboldeneth mee to ſend this Epiſtle to your Lordſhip, to giue you a iuſt account of my Time, Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and Seruice, which as it is not altogether a Stranger, ſo I hope it may a little reuiue againe thoſe thoughts, which howſoeuer you may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to lay by, yet I know you will neuer vtterly forſake or abandon.</p>
               <p>I haue in the former Epiſtle ſhewed the neceſſary vſe both of <hi>Warre,</hi> and the <hi>Souldier,</hi> and that as the maine Columbe of a Common-wealth, it keepes all eſtates vpright and euen. Now I am to aſcend to the Glorie thereof, then which there is not any flame of profeſſion whatſoeuer that can aſpire beyond it, or of the goodneſſe of his fires make a Starre more fixed and enduring: for as all Arts are ſooner attained then this, by quiet ſtudie, warme eaſe, and ſound reſt, neither perplexing the mind, nor put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the body in danger: ſo the Souldier (whoſe ends are euer high and great) findes difficultie in all his deſignes, dangers in his attempts, and death both the Crown and Song of his Conqueſt and Triumph: nor are they ſutable to any particular proportion, but euen married and allied to euery warlike action; as, whether with <hi>Alexander</hi> he ſeeke the conqueſt of the world, or with
<hi>Hanibal</hi> ſtriue but to defend a particular citie: for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14641:11"/>Souldiers cannot march farre ſitting ſtill, nor compaſſe much with poore endeauors, as their aymes are great, ſo muſt be their actions and as their deſires are infinite, ſuch muſt be their dangers: which conſidered, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that their glory ought farre to exceed all others. Souldiers are for the moſt part men of great and incomparable Spirits, which is ſuch a glorious Garment, and ſo precious a Iewell wherewith to adorne <hi>Vertue,</hi> that it ſets her forth in the higheſt degree of all excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie and perfection, where on the contrary, baſe, low, little and ſtraight minds, who haue nothing of price in them but life, not any thing wiſe but their feares, nor any Bountie more than a continuall affection to worldly riches. Theſe are in no ſort fit for emploiments of this Martiall and high nature. The true Souldier takes
<hi>Scipio</hi> for his example, and is like him, ſpare of ſpeech and euer muſing; lookes vpon <hi>Saluſt,</hi> and with him is ſecret in his counſels, but open in his actions; and admires <hi>Furius Camillus,</hi> with whom hee is neither puffed vp by any ſucceſſe in <hi>Fortune,</hi> nor yet abaſhed or deiected, though his deſignes runne neuer ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately to ruine and diſorder. Hence it comes, that the greateſt Princes ſtile all men of Warre their Fellow-Souldiers; and the meaneſt amongſt them (in the way of Vaſſailage) diſdaine to ſerue the greateſt perſons, well may they ſerue vnder them, but cannot be truly ſaid to ſerue them: their hands they may commaund to vſe the Sword, not to carry a Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; their minds they may inflame with courage, not quench with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; and their bodies they may ſacrifice to Glory, but not offer vp either to their Luſts, Pride, or Ambitions.</p>
               <p>All Warres are either Offenſiue or Defenſiue, to inuade others, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue themſelues, either of which no man ought to vndertake but for a glorious purpoſe. To God belongeth our actions, to him therefore and his Glorie ought all Warre to bee dedicate: For Warres offenſiue or Inuading, they muſt euer be either to plant Gods Name and Chriſtian Religion amongſt vs, or elſe to regaine thoſe Rights and Dominions, which (formerly being giuen from God) haue been iniuriouſly taken and withheld from the true and lawfull owners: and of this we haue plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full examples in holy Writ, both in the Stories of <hi>Moſes, Ioſua, Dauid,</hi> and the
<hi>Maccabees,</hi> of which (if wee ſhould ſpeake particularly) ſome haue been commaunded by Gods owne mouth to make warres, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, yea to take no Truce, but to kill euery liuing Soule: others haue themſelues aſſumed Armes, to theſe ends, and by theſe examples; and ſome haue regained their vniuſt loſſes by a lawfull Warre, vnder a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine authoritie. As theſe, ſo other great mindes (though much leſſe in true holy knowledge, and with a much ſcanter Warrant) furniſhed with great ſucceſſe, haue imbarked themſelues into great actions, and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing humane ends, as Scales to their high Thoughts, haue become glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly victorious in the world; as <hi>Ninus</hi> in the firſt age, <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the ſecond, <hi>Alexander</hi> in the third, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the fourth: all theſe haue had glorious ends, and famous Names, and their memory will continue whilſt Time hath continuance. But when I fixe them againſt the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14641:11"/>of Chriſtian and godly Captaines, ſuch as was our firſt <hi>Richard</hi> in the Holy land, <hi>Burbon</hi> before
<hi>Rome,</hi> Great <hi>Henrie</hi> of <hi>Fraunce</hi> againſt the League, or our renowned <hi>Henries</hi> of England pulling their Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rights from ſuch as vſurped them: then me thinks like new Starres they are either loſt at their firſt finding, or like eclipſed lights haue in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues no beautie but ſuch as is borrowed.</p>
               <p>The Glory which appertaines to a perfit Souldier is of a two-fold Nature, the one <hi>Terreſtriall,</hi> the other
<hi>Celeſtiall:</hi> of the firſt no doubt euery Heathen Conquerour will be a glorious partaker, and memorie ſhall keepe their memories, as long as Marble, Braſſe, or the leaues of Bookes ſhall endure: But the Champions of the Almightie ſhall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified for euer and euer, both heere in the world, and after beyond all worlds. Firſt therefore let Gods Battels be fought, for that is the Tithe of our duties: Next, our Princes, for that is the Rent of our Seruice: and laſtly, our Countries, for that is the Fee due from our Gratitude: and in theſe two latter obligations there ought to be ſuch a coreſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with Goodneſſe, that Princes ought not to ingage themſelues in any action without God, becauſe God will not commaund vs any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment but by the Prince, whom hee hath aſſigned his Deputie, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding vs Warre but for the King, and not to dare (in any ſemblance whatſoeuer) to leuie or raiſe Armes, but by and at the eſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the King: for ſo glorious is the profeſſion of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, that it is onely to bee raiſed for God by the King. Subiects in other things haue great Priuiledges, in this they are confined, for Warre is Gods great buſineſſe, and whoſoeuer leads, he ſtill ſhould be Generall.</p>
               <p>Now for warres Defenſiue (which queſtionleſſe are more warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) they haue likewiſe moſt glorious ends: For when God hath giuen to a people a Prince either by iuſt Conqueſt, or lawfull Succeſſion, if then the violence of Tyrannie, the falſhood of Treaſon, or the greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Ambition, ſeeke to ſubuert and diſpoſſeſſe what God hath planted: O how iuſtly then are Armes aſſumed, and how infinite is the Glory which depends on ſo noble a Reformation! Slaughter (a thing moſt odious to God and Nature) in this caſe Heauen doth not onely permit it, but commaund it; and men-killers in this ſeruice ſhall bee crowned not alone with Oake, but with Lawrell; nay to ſuch perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they attaine, that men dying with wounds of this vertuous nature, like ſo many
<hi>Martyrs</hi> (with their laſt gaſpe) they are borne triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into heauen: I meane not thoſe wicked Darers, which make the Warres their whoore, on whom they vent the pollutions of their ſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering Natures, making Rapin, Ryot, and Diſorder the three cornerd cap to couer the head of their purpoſe. But ſuch as vndergoe the cauſe of Conſcience, whoſe Warrant is from God, and whoſe actions are mooued by a ſollid and ſtedfaſt dutie fixt on their Prince and Countrey. Theſe doubtleſſe (how great ſoeuer the ſtreame of Blood be which they ſpill) ſhall ſhine with Martyrs at the laſt day; yea, though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14641:12"/>with weakneſſes of more then a tollerable proportion, yet is the cauſe ſo good, that their hope cannot chuſe but aſcend to an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite meaſure.</p>
               <p>To conclude then mine Epiſtle; if both in warres Offenſiue and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue the cauſe bee ſo good, and the action ſo full of Splendor, how much Glory ought to be aſcribed vnto them: as the glory of apparell and ornaments of perſon, Crownes and Plumes, Scarfes and Garlands, Glory of the liuing (as great mens praiſes, and meane mens admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,) and Glory of the dead (as Tombes and Colloſſes, Achiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Hearſes, Temples, Trophies, and eternall Epitaphs) this they purchaſe with Blood, this they deſerue by Vertue; this makes them beloued at home, and redoubted abroad; this makes good Princes ſeeke them, and bad Princes feare them; and this who not affords them, muſt to himſelfe affoard, <hi>He is not vertuous.</hi>

And on the contrary part, if ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor forbid any attempt (how glorious and gratious ſoeuer in humaine apprehenſion) yet muſt not then the noble Souldier dare to touch it, no not ſo much as bend a thought againſt it, were all the crownes and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands in the world ſtackt downe for his recompence; no luker muſt intice him, no pleaſure ſeduce him, nor any glory inchaunt him. Honor is the Souldiers Miſtris, and her commandements are ſo ſacred that it were high Treaſon to God, to nature and good manners to violate her leaſt Statute; Beſides he is ſo curious of diſgrace, and ſo iealous of any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary imputation, that whoſoeuer will enioy her muſt bee as carefull and fearefull to perſerue her vnſpotted, Oh Sacred <hi>Honor</hi> thy knot is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable, and betwixt thee and vertue is ſuch a faithfull coniunction that no wiſdome will, no Charme can, and no good Sword dare euer ſeeke to deuide you.</p>
               <p>But pauſe a little, for me thinkes I heare ſome obiections thundred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me? what? doe all Souldiers enioy <hi>Honor?</hi> no: nor doe all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue her? excellent were that Edict, if all that deſerue her might enioy her; what? is ſhe then incertaine? no neither; only ſhee is coy in her wooing, and comes to her louers after a ſundry faſhion; yet let no Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier be diſcouraged, for whoſoeuer truly doth deſerue her; ſhall be ſure to enioy her, either here, or in a place of better reſiding; for there is no maxime truer then this, that men are full of blindnes, and ſuch as often haue the diſtribution of <hi>Honor</hi> doe ſometimes miſtake their marke, and hit a contrary obiect, yet notwithſtanding whoſoeuer truely deſerueth; let him thus farre aſſure himſelfe; he ſhall either finde honor, in this world; or in the preſent, or in the future time, or (which is beſt of all) in another world, euen to the vttermoſt length of the longeſt eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>But doth the honor of a Souldier heere take vp its Inne and reſt; hath it no other harbor but his <hi>Actions, Words</hi> and
<hi>Thoughts?</hi> yes, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry geſtures, ſhewes and outward faſhions of a Souldier muſt alſo be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, no looke, no behauiour, no countenance whatſoeuer but like <hi>Achilles</hi> Speare muſt both wound and heale, to his friends he muſt be amiable and chearefull, and throwing his beames of loue into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes, like <hi>Romulus</hi> dart they muſt haue the vertue to take roote, and by no other ſtrength be able to be remooued, thus ſhall his ſweeteneſſe<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14641:14"/>drawe and fixe Soules inſeperably vnto him, and thus ſhall a noble po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity arme him with a loue which no violence can conquer; to this ſweetneſſe of countenance, he muſt adde the cheerefulnes of his valour and by the examples of his perſon draw all hands to aſſiſt him, hee muſt be the firſt in aſſaults and laſt in retraites, in all keeping ſuch a compoſed hermony of diſtinct and noble parts, that from the characters of his well framed graces, all his followers may draw, Courage, Care or Controul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; On the contrary part, his countenance to his Enemie muſt be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, his blowes heauy and frequent, his aduantages ſo ſoone gained, and his diſaduantages ſo ſoone perceiued that the world in the leaſt of theſe perfit things may know how to ſhape or modell forth all the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry parts of <hi>Honor,</hi> in the moſt compleateſt perfection.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Epiſtle, he that ſhall thus linke euery facultie in him to <hi>Honor;</hi> ſhall be able in any aſſault of fortune whatſoeuer to expreſſe theſe three noble duties: firſt that of a King (ſhewing authority and good fortune) then that of a Captaine (ordering things ſpeedily, wiſely, without diſorder, without danger) and laſtly that of a Souldier making good euery place where hazards are moſt libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally beſtowed; this is a Souldiers <hi>Honor,</hi> and this is moſt excellent.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince (my good Lord) the Profeſſion of a Souldier is neceſſary, his ends glorious, and his qualitie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, let vs now enter into conſideration what kinde of perſon is fitteſt to vndergoe this excellent calling: and in this might bee held an infinite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; but the rules of <hi>Symetrie</hi> loſe here their proportion, I muſt therefore conclude that the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt man to make a Souldier, is a perfit Gentleman: for generous Spirits are euer apteſt for great deſignes; yet in reſpect multitudes compound armies, and that Gentlemen are not of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite increaſe in all parts to ſupply them; I muſt this affirme in the right of all Souldiers, that whoſe great minde ſoeuer willingly carrieth him to the imbracing of this noble Profeſſion, whatſoeuer his Birth be, his minde is generous; and although his imployment may reſt at the loweſt degree of Fortune; yet vpon the firſt apprehenſion of Vertue, equall Iuſtice ſhould allowe him the Stile and Reward of a Gentleman of the Companie. Next Birth, his Education ſhould be liberall and free; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſeruitude of Apprentices, nor baſeneſſe of Slaues, for both are badges of vnworthineſſe. The earlieſt age to paſſe Muſters, is at ſeuenteene: for before the bodie is weake in performance, and after it will daily grow more mature till it attaine to perfection. Loſſe of time is offenſiue, and as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſaith of Phyſicke, ſo ſhall a Souldier finde of the Warres, that it is <hi>Ars longa, Vita breuis.</hi> For his Size or Proportion, he would be wiſht generally, Strong, Actiue, Comely, and Perfect; and though of theſe all cannot bee found to fill vp all places, yet the more<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14641:15"/>the better and fitter for this purpoſe. The Warres (no doubt) can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men which haue weake Sences, and worſe Limbes, yet common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are ſuch on whom wounds in Seruice haue beſtowed thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, and ſo are accounted no Scarres but Glories; for Honour euer ſets her Seale deepe on her valianteſt ſeruants, and thoſe which thus carry the ſtampe of great actions, are (for the moſt part) men of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and though fitter for direction then execution, yet ſo behooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for both, that without them ſometimes the whole Bodie of Armes would reele and wauer: But when I come to thinke of a minde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting a Souldier, I can onely ſay this, That how curious, coſtly, plaine or deformed ſoeuer the Cabanet be, yet muſt it neceſſarily be filled with all manner of Vertues; Vice muſt bee as that deadly foe with whom he will neuer make Truce, or euer capitulate; and the Bulwarke to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand her aſſaults, muſt be his Pietie and Religion; vnder the guard of theſe he muſt finde his ſecuritie: for hee who euery day comes to haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his life, had need bee prepared for a good paſſage; he muſt be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant (for that is a Souldiers proper vertue) valiant to conquer his Countreyes foes, and valiant to ouerthrowe his owne paſſions. What great attempt is done but by daring? <hi>Alexander</hi> that had ſwomme ouer the armes of the Sea <hi>Heliſponte,</hi> will not bee ſtayed at the paſſage of the Riuer <hi>Granicke; Caeſar</hi> will bee ſeene at <hi>Pharſalia, Auguſtus</hi> at <hi>Philippi,</hi> and
<hi>Varro</hi> in <hi>Spaine.</hi> To conclude, all the perfection of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in one Chriſtian Souldier, <hi>Henrie</hi> the great of
<hi>Fraunce,</hi> will bee ſeene to take <hi>Eaux,</hi> with but eight men in his company, and when a ſlaue clapt his Harquebuze to his boſome, ſaying,
<hi>(Now I could)</hi> the King ſtrooke it away with his Piſtoll, and replied, <hi>(But doe what God will let thee.)</hi> At the taking of
<hi>Cahors,</hi> the next vnto him was ſlaine, and when mens courages began to faint, it is ſaid that his valour did like liquid <hi>Bitumen,</hi> ſet all on fire that were about him. At <hi>Nerac</hi> with ten horſe hee receiued the charge of three hundred; made good his ground, and recouered his ſafetie with ſuch warlike diſcretion, that the Marſhall
<hi>Marignon</hi> bluſhing, cried out <hi>His Fortune was infinite.</hi> Infinite others I could recite, but this is is enough to ſhew that a Souldiers valour link't with diſcretion, is ſeldome or neuer forſaken of good Fortune.</p>
               <p>To this Valour then, Wiſedome muſt needs be ioyned; for if in any condition of men true Iudgement be requiſite, it muſt be in a Souldier, for to him belongs the diſcerning eye which ſeperates God from Euill, right from wrong, and faire play from Iniurie, both in graue conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where the State and Prince are engaged, as alſo in caſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, where God and mans Conſcience haue an equall partaking. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vpon preſent occaſion, when Battering, Aſſaulting, Mining, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fighting hand to hand, giuing and receiuing aduantage according vnto times and ſeaſons are in the <hi>Solſtice</hi> of their Greatnes, what Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is then to bee applied, who is ſo ſimple as hath not a ſence to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. To this Wiſedome muſt Iuſtice be annexed, and as our Souldier himſelfe muſt be Iuſt, ſo Iuſt muſt bee is quarrell, and as Iuſt the vſe and<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14641:15"/>manage of his weapon; his lawfull Prince muſt imploy him, not the heate of his owne Blood or deſire of Action; his Alleageance muſt moue him, not hope of Aduauncement; and his Conſcience muſt tie him, not Spoyle or Boot-haling. The Sword that is imbrewed in Chriſtian blood, muſt haue a ſtrong acquittance, or the Soule that rul'd it muſt anſwere for Blood; therefore let rather the commaundement of him that hath power conſtraine thee, then thine owne ambition leade thee, and being conſtrained, make not all fiſh which comes to thy net, take not all thou canſt catch, nor force not all thou canſt ſubdue: remember the loſſe of Blood is dangerous, if Nature doth not conſent vnto it, nor the Phyſition allow it. Know it is ſo neceſſary for the preſeruation of mans body, that from what part ſoeuer it goes, we muſt ſeeke to ſtay it; and to that purpoſe <hi>Numa</hi> made a Law, and <hi>Licurgus</hi> obſerued a Law; therfore in all thine attempts, ſpare blood as much as conueniently thou canſt: Raze no Temples, deface no Monuments, nor defile Virgins: hold that Maxime amongſt Souldiers for a Paradox, which affirmes, That when men enter by aſſault, it is lawfull to vſe all manner of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and violence. Iuſtice hath an euener Scale, by which to meaſure mens actions, and for mine one part I am of opinion, that howſoeuer it bee a Militarie Poſition grounded on two cauſes: the one, to deterre the enemie from ſtanding to the laſt minute; the other, to encourage thoſe whoſe endes are ſpoyle and reuengement, yet there is a fayrer path vnto Conqueſt, and the cruelleſt Princes that euer breath'd haue ſtayed themſelues in this carriere, where by the examples of other ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, they haue lookt into their owne frailties, and ſeeing they were but men, haue acknowledged that ſomewhat might happen in an inſtant, which might make them no more what they were, or ſend them ſomewhere elſe, or leaue them not to be at all; and indeed I haue ſeene worthy Commanders moſt ſtrictly forbid it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, our Souldier muſt both in himſelfe and in all things bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Temperate, commanding himſelfe in all paſſions, without An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Feare, Hate, or Luſt, in ſuch ſort as he may euer ſtand vpon himſelfe, and be to himſelfe the ſelfe Supporter. To his enemies he muſt bequeath his Anger; to God, his Feare; to vice, his hate; and if hee luſt at all, it muſt be euer after Vertue. He muſt be Temperate in dyet; for Souldiers are euer ſubiect to exceſſe: which I rather gather to proceed from their wants at other times, then from the naturall inclination of an vnreſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fancie; for as our Feaſtes commonly ſucceed our Faſtes: ſo when Souldiers haue been griped with hunger, and then come to the ouerflow of abundance, Moderation leaues them, and deſire findes no curbe by which to be reſtrained. But becauſe ſuch as will doe much, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie ſuffer much, let our Souldier in this place arme himſelfe with all the ſtrength of indurance, let him make companions of long Marches, ſharpe Abſtinence, painefull watchings, early wakings, and hard lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings: let him take Silence by the tongue, and Secrecie by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; let him wooe all diſtemperatures, and ſtieke them as fauours<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14641:16"/>about him, the malice of the ayre, of heate, of cold, of drought, and of moyſture; let no ſtep want Care, nor any motion its Vigilance; eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Buſh may yeeld a Bullet, euery Foard a Skirmiſh, and euery By-path a danger, Bridges may bee broken, Paſſages barrocadoed, men may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Spies, and the ayre it ſelfe may be made vnwholeſome. This let him learne to know, this let him learne to indure, and this will make all hazards familiar. To conclude, as to this life of a Souldier doth belong all the miſeries that can be conceiued: ſo to the ſame muſt bee fixt as an Armour, the greateſt Patience that euer was profeſſed: ſo ſhall our Souldier bee victorious euery way, and all the vices of Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Raſhneſſe, Murther, Robbery, Rauiſhment, Folly, Dulneſſe, Riot, Deceit, Pride and Couetouſneſſe, which like ſo many infections lurke about Armies, ſhall as diſperſt clouds flie from his preſence, and leaue him to the world beloued and admired.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing Imbarqued my ſelfe into this Ocean of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary profeſſion, there is no remedy (my very good Lord) But howeuer crazie or vntight my pore Veſſell be, it muſt ſtil put forth into the Sea; &amp; (though ſtorms ſpeak neuer ſo loud) wraſtle among them, being now too late either to fould vp Saile or caſt Anchor; ſince ſhame is a nearer Neighbour to the Retraite, then hope or glory could be to the Onſet: Be it then your Lordſhips noble fauour to ſaue this pore Epiſtle from the wracke of Enuy, and when it ſhall ariue at your preſence, bee pleaſed to heare the Meſſage it ſhall deliuer, and I doubt not but though it can bring litle to fortifie or augment your knowledge, yet it ſhall leaue behind ſomething worthy to be retayned in your beſt Memory.</p>
               <p>I haue (my Lord) in the foregoing Epiſtles diſcourſed how
<hi>Neceſsary, Glorious, Honorable,</hi> and <hi>Vertuous</hi> the profeſſion of a Souldier is; It reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth now that I proceed to the
<hi>Reward</hi> or <hi>Merrit</hi> due to ſo excellent a calling; for there can be no capacity ſo abſurd or vngratefull as to deny a duty ſo fit and abſolutly belonging, and which indeed ought neither by Couetouſneſſe to be made leſſe, nor by any vſurpation to be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or paſt ouer to a Subiect of a lower Station, how gaudy or glorious ſoeuer in common or perticular aprehenſion.</p>
               <p>The Reward of a Souldier is no new thing, neither is it deriued from any weake circumſtances; for it hath <hi>Gratitude</hi> as a guid to leade it, and <hi>Good-Example</hi> as a ſweete companion with which it holdeth continuall Fellowſhip, ſo that when at any time this duty of
<hi>Reward</hi> is neglected by them in whom this Office of diſtribution conſiſteth; there not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hapneth an imputation of forgotten thankefulneſſe, (which is a great breach to all humaine ſociety, but alſo a violent ſuppreſſing or keeping downe of vertue, by depriuing the world of thoſe preſidents which ſhould inflame and ſtirre others to noble achiuements (which is the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ecay and loſſe of Courage,) for all Merit hath its Reward, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Reward begeteth a new Merit from the brauery of the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; It is no new thing, for it began in the firſt world, euen in that which<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14641:17"/>was moſt goulden, for doe but ſearch ouer the Sacred Scriptures &amp; you ſhall finde them exceeding plentifull both of examples and Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which may be ſuited to this purpoſe; as firſt in <hi>Moſes</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing authority from God himſelfe to goe before the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> and to lead them vnto warre, hee that was Gods greateſt Generall, and the greateſt Gouernour of the greateſt Army, he that commanded all and was obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all, that made <hi>Colonels</hi> ouer Tribes, and Captaines ouer companies, that being ordered himſelfe by God, ordered all his martiall affaires ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods appoyntment; was not he that thus pleaſed God, of God ſingularly rewarded? yes doubtleſſe, &amp; that in an infinite meaſure, for beſides his eminent command and greatnes, God vouchſafed to ſpeak with him face to face, to direct him in all his deſignes, to giue bleſſinges to all his proceedings, &amp; (which neuer any but himſelfe could boaſt off) to diſcouer vnto him ſo much of his Heauenly Eſſence as mortality was able to behold, or mans nature reach to in the height of admiration; God Created him a Duke ouer <hi>Iſraell,</hi> victorious in many Battailes, and hath ſpread his fame ſo vniuerſally ouer the face of the whole world, that it cannot decay or periſh, but ſhall continue to the end of the world; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this Reward of martiall excellence bounded only vpon <hi>Moſes</hi> and no other, but dilated and extended fourth it ſelfe, euen to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Souldier in his Campe &amp; meaneſt wel deſeruer; for in recompence of their proweſſe he gaue them that land which flowed with milke &amp; hony.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Ioſua</hi> (who was appoynted <hi>Moſes</hi> ſucceſſor) God gaue the like ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, the like Reward, and the like admiration; nay he made the Sunne at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Battels, and whereſoeuer he ſet downe his foote, there fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Conqueſt euer ſtood by him. What ſhal I ſpeake of <hi>Dauid</hi> (who for his Conqueſt got both a Crowne and the Kings daughter) and a world of others: of which examples the Scriptures are infinite rich, for euen our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe doth not only alow the Souldier his pay, but alſo in many places ſpeaketh of the greatnes of the <hi>Centurions</hi> and their worthy aduancements; which proofes, ſince they are aboue all poofes, it is needles to wade further into humaine examples; But let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one in whom the power of rewarding of Souldiers doth conſiſt, apply himſelfe to doe as his Maſter hath done before him; who although for his excellency and perfection he be altogether vnimitable, yet in as much as he accepteth this <hi>Quantum in Nobis;</hi> let them ſtriue to doe the vttermoſt of their endeauours, and know that God accepteth a willing attempt, though it be done neuer ſo weakly.</p>
               <p>But the queſtion (in this place) reſteth what the Reward is, which Souldiers may moſt propperly challenge: to which I reply, that there are in this world three moſt eſpeciall things, which as <hi>Honorarie</hi> and <hi>Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> rights depend and belong to euery well deſeruing Souldier; that is to ſay <hi>Fame, Honor</hi> and <hi>Wealth,</hi> for without theſe hee can hardly ſubſiſt, becauſe they are the matter or Cement which gleweth or bindeth him and his vertue inſeperably together.</p>
               <p>To ſpeake then of the firſt, there is nothing which a Souldier ought to<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14641:17"/>deſir in this world before a good
<hi>Fame,</hi> for it is the food of his reputation and nouriſheth Honor with ſuch ſweete milke, that it growes ſo able and ſtrong as no diſaſter or miſchance of Fortune can moue or ſhake it, much leſſe abaſe or ſubuert it, neither ought he to thirſt after any thing with a more greedy appetite then after good <hi>Fame,</hi> becauſe it quencheth al the flames of euill report, and maketh Slaunder ſo dumbe &amp; toungty'd, that it dare not ſuffer bad words to haue any alliance with murmuring, nor falſe bruits with raſh iudgements of publique actions, neither dare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any vertue to be greater then that of obedience; Now as this muſt be a good <hi>Fame,</hi> ſo it muſt be a true <hi>Fame</hi> not a falſe ſhaddow, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuborned from the vulgar by deceite, or arrogated by power from other mens bloody ſweats or dangerous achiuements, it muſt not be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique vices daub'd ouer with vertuous habits, as <hi>Cruelty</hi> with <hi>Iuſtice, Baſeneſse,</hi> with <hi>Humility, Prodigality</hi> with <hi>Bounty,</hi> or <hi>Auarice</hi> with <hi>Thrift;</hi> for all theſe are piebald counterfeite reproaches and no true <hi>Fame;</hi> that which is good Report indeed like gold can neither rot nor bee changed into any other metall; it will endure the teſte of the ſtrongeſt Enuy, and abide the touch of the pureſt wiſdome or iudgement; It is not ſo light or inſubſtanciall to be carryed about the ayre with euery whirle-wind, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet ſo dull and leaden heel'd, but vpon any noble and worthy occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it can flie to the vttermoſt corners of the earth, and like a curtaine, cloath all the Ayre from one ſide to another; This is that which a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier may purſue without diſgrace, and poſeſſe without malice, yet when he is come within diſtance (and that like an eager <hi>Faulcon</hi> it ſtoopes to his luer) let him rather receiue it then aſſume it, for it is a coy Miſtris at which a man may reach but not ſnatch, yet if any iniuriouſly ſhould ſeeke to rauiſh it, or depriue the deſeruing owner of it, I am of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; that if in any caſe a <hi>Duell</hi> might be admitted, then this is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident,</p>
               <p>The ſecond reward belonging to a Souldier is <hi>Honor,</hi> which as men muſt endeauour to deſerue, ſo Princes muſt vouchſafe to beſtow; neither ought they to hoodwinke their eies in theſe occaſions, but Lyon like to ſee into <hi>Deſerts</hi> both ſleeping &amp; waking, for as Souldiers muſt ſcatter &amp; loſe their actions, ſo Princes muſt find them and cloath them with a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit due to their goodnes, for it is no part of the nature of a good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to hunt after Honor, or like a rauenous Beaſt to make prey his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; much leſſe to buy it with bribes, or make it his whore with which to fornicate, tis blood, not gold which hath euer beene the price of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and howſoeuer baſe people are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly the beſt hoarders of gold, &amp; ſo with that witchcraft inchaunt many times vndeſerued Honor vnto them, yet let the true Souldier loſe that imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (for the act is vnwor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy) &amp; let it ſuffice him to deſerue it though others inioy it; It is not queſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>onable but euery man in his due place (by the mediation of his vertue) ſhould receiue Honor according to his Range, as the Generall of an Army Royall may well deſerue to ranke with a Duke (for from thence I boubt not but <hi>Dux</hi> firſt tooke his originall) a Liuetenant generall with<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14641:18"/>an Earle, the Martiall of the Field with a Viſcount, the principall Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels with Barons; and the inferior Commanders with inferior places, according to the pleaſure of the Prince, and worthynes of his vertue, for as <hi>Honor</hi> is only the Princes by right, ſo in the diſtribution thereof he ought to performe all rights; All whatſoeuer the Souldier can ſay is his; in that hath the Prince the greater intereſt, which finding to be imployed only in his commandements, how is he bound both vnto <hi>Truth</hi> &amp; <hi>Care</hi> that the diſtribution of Honor be iuſtly performed, in which whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he ſwarueth from the right path he not only indangers his vertue, but makes a pittifull hazard of his owne Honor and Safety.</p>
               <p>The laſt but leaſt Reward of a Souldier is <hi>Wealth</hi> or temporall Goods; which howſoeuer in ſome meaſure they may be diſpiſed, yet are they ſo neceſſary for our frailtie; &amp; ſuch a defence againſt the tempeſts of War, that without them a Souldier can neither performe nor continue the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Calling, and therefore the beſtowing or vſe thereof admits great conſideration, for they are to be accommodated both to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the perſon, and nature of the place in which the Souldier is imployed; fitting the proportion of the Souldiers entertainement to the greatnes or ſmalenes of his rancke and aduancement, neither ſhould the limitation of this entertainement bee circumſcribed within the bounds of the Warres only; but howſoeuer they wane or decreaſe yet ſhould the well deſeruing Souldier at no time bee neglected, and herein the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> obſerueth a moſt noble courſe, who to all Officers of what Raunge ſoeuer, continually doth allow penſions for life ſuitable to their degrees, how euer either the ſeſſation of warre, or Imbecillity of perſon makes them vnfite for imployment: Competency is a conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Bounty, and though to nouriſh Armyes weaken the powers of the richeſt Princes, yet to relieue Officers &amp; men of emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; high vertue, is an obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to which they are bound by a rule in Contie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; for to this purpoſe <hi>Conſtantine</hi> built the great Colledge of <hi>Saint Iohns</hi> neare <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; Spaine</hi> boaſts the great reuenewes due to the order of <hi>Calatraua;</hi> and we here in <hi>England</hi> keepe the memory of Maſter <hi>Suttons</hi> famous founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>Romans</hi> did ſtudie many other rewards for Souldiers as Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, orders of Knighthood, Rings, Funeral orations, Crownes, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, Roabes &amp; a world of other deuices; all which were as Spurs to ſet them forward in the Careire to vertue through all dangers whatſoeuer, that doing almoſt Actions impoſſible, they not only brought the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt but the beſt part of the world vnder their ſubiection; And doubtles there is nothing in the world that can ſo ſoone ſummon vp a mans ſpirits to vertue as the hope of reward, for it is the Adama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which draweth the Iron heart aloft, making it ſoare into the clowds &amp; to be inſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible of thoſe paines, which without this matter of prize would make things (fecible &amp; eaſie) ſeeme inacceſſible, difficult &amp; not to be indured; let no man then rob <hi>Honors</hi> workman of his hyer; but rather ad &amp; fill vp his meaſure to the hyeſt continent, ſo ſhall he giue the Angels cauſe to reioyce, fill the world with praiſe, &amp; make the hearts of men a ſacrifice to his goodnes.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Range of this Epiſtle did no ſooner point me to your Lordſhip, when preſently there aroſe in my remembrance a thouſand figures of thoſe fauours and delights which in the firſt Spring of mine age I had gathered from your noble Goodnes, all which did not onely inuite, but conſtraine me to a ſerious conſideration how I might beautifie &amp; adorne this ſacrifice of my pen, to make it appeare vnto you like my heart, both faithfull and vnchanging. But when I lookt into the bluntneſſe of mine owne nature, the vnfitneſſe of Curioſitie in ſo rough a ſubiect, and the little valew of words, if Sence doe not compound the Muſique, I preſently concluded that the neereſt way to my purpoſe was to bee fartheſt off from affectation, and that your Lordſhip would then ſooneſt beleeue there was no ſparke of my firſt affection quencht or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, when you ſaw I ſought ſtill to ſerue you with the ſame plainneſſe and Truth which I had euer profeſſed.</p>
               <p>The matter which I am to diſcourſe in this Epiſtle is the dignitie and vſe of thoſe Souldiers, which we call by the name of
<hi>Voluntaries,</hi> being a ranke of men which voluntarily, and of their owne meere motion, without any conſtraint at all, doe betake themſelues vnto the Warres, grounding the ſtrength of their deſires thereunto, vpon ſome vertuous and honeſt purpoſe, and of theſe there are diuers kindes, as ſome Noblemen, ſome Gentlemen, and ſome Yeomen, all Freemen, Good men, Able men, and theſe haue diuers inducements to draw them to this purpoſe, as either ſome eſpeciall obligation of ſeruice to the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,</hi> or ſome other great perſon then commanding in the warres, or elſe an inflammation of courage, kindling a deſire to behold the warres, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14641:19"/>to learne the miſteries therof, either they are ſtirred vp with the goodnes of the quarrell, or elſe admoniſhed thereunto by a vertuous, emulation in beholding the glory of other mens aduancement: for thus was <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> ſent to the warres, and brought vp in his fathers pauilion: thus <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> made <hi>Druſus</hi> a Souldier; and thus went <hi>Iugurth</hi> to <hi>Affrica,</hi> that hee might become
<hi>Scipios</hi> Scholler: this made <hi>Henry</hi> the great of
<hi>France,</hi> a Generall at ten yeares of age: this made the Duke of
<hi>Auſtria</hi> to be ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſonne of <hi>Fortune;</hi> and this makes the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (that now liueth) the admiration of all Souldiers, and queſtionleſſe in a noble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit nothing appeareth of greater luſtre: for it is a rule, that <hi>whoſoeuer will endeauour to command, he muſt firſt learne to obey; and hee that will hereafter be imitated, muſt himſelfe haue the practiſe of others imitations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Voluntaries</hi> for the moſt part arme themſelues according to their owne pleaſures; for they are both intended to bee men of wealth and abilitie, and alſo a great eaſe to the publike purſe, in as much as they ought to liue on their owne charge, without the Princes pay, or the warres exhibition: it is alſo lawfull in them to make election in what manner thay will ſerue, whether on horſebacke or on foot, or on both, as the occaſion of preſent ſeruice ſhall adminiſter vnto them: for hauing both horſe and attendants to accommodate them in euery neceſſitie, they need not be abſent in any Seruice, but may be witneſſes of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is done, bee it either after the one, or the other manner. Theſe as they receiue no pay, ſo they paſſe no Muſters, neither are they tied to any ſtrictneſſe of any particular dutie, but as free and noble Gentlemen may beſtow their houres in any honourable faſhion: They may onely claime the benefit of the Generals Table, and a principall reſpect both from the greateſt and the leſſer Commanders: for thereby there is not onely brought a ſweetneſſe both to their expence and hazards, but alſo it giueth a notable incouragement to others to purſue the like courſe, and ſo become more enabled to performe excellent things, when either their King or Countrey ſhall haue cauſe to imploy them. And for mine owne part I haue ſeene, when in the neceſſitie of affaires, and when the approch of the enemy hath awakened a double Regard to preuent danger, that theſe voluntary Gentlemen haue beene more diligent in Watches, and more ſeuere in performing all manner of duties then any mercenary Souldier whatſoeuer; in which they haue ſhewed both a ſingular affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the profeſſion they had vndertaken, made themſelues a great deale more able and perfit: and laſtly breed both a delight in the well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and a ſhame and reproach to thoſe Sluggards whoſe Cowardiſe and Sloth hath to the by-ſtanders adminiſtred any euill examples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Voluntaries</hi> may challenge in all Marches the moſt honourable and principall places of the Battell (which are vnder commaundement) as in the morning vpon the point or head of the Vauntguard, and at night (vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on retrait) at the foot or laſt part of the Reare. If it be in priuate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, they ought (in curteſie) to haue the leading of the principal Files, to be in the Reare, or amongſt the Middle men and Subdiuiſion at their<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14641:19"/>owne election, for whereſoeuer they march, they are euer a grace to the Battalia, and both by their courage and example make euen the dulleſt, apt for to follow their imitation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Voluntaries</hi> were wont to be but ſome few eſpeciall perſons in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and were accounted <hi>Rara Auis in terris:</hi> but in theſe our latter ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times, when <hi>Generals</hi> haue (out of popularitie) been leſſe ſparing of <hi>Honour,</hi> and more prodigall (then their forefathers) in beſtowing all manner of martiall Bounties, what through the enticement of <hi>Loue,</hi> the hope of <hi>Aduancement,</hi> and the incantation of <hi>Knighthood,</hi> the number of them hath been infinitly increaſed: ſo that the mixture being wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vnproper, and the Priuiledges which they aſſumed needleſſe, and without diſtinction, they haue bred ſuch a confuſion, that in Marching, Fighting, Lodging, nay not ſo much but in Victualing they haue rather brought foorth the fruits of Trouble and diſorder, then either eaſe or perfection to any part of the Armie: and of this both <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>England</hi> haue taſted in a very large meaſure; the firſt inforcing the King to erect his
<hi>Blanch-Cornet,</hi> the other ſeeing imbarqued both for <hi>Cadiz</hi> and the Iſlands a Regiment of <hi>Voluntaries,</hi> farre ſurmounting any other through the whole Armie; ſome led by their owne ambition, ſome by their wiues, and ſome (as they ſay dogges goe to Church) onely for company, without either noble end, or almoſt a tollerable purpoſe: for as they were led on by vaine glory, ſo commonly they were followed by want, and finiſhed with diſgrace and diſhonor: for their pride (for the moſt part) made them foes to Diſcipline, and their feares and follies kept them in ſuch an extrauagant courſe, that as well might a man rule a herd of wild Bulles as a Band of ſuch vnruly Colts, in whom was neither wiſdome, order, nor diſcretion: And to make this good, I dare affirme, that in one ſeruice, I ſaw a whole afternoone ſpent (by excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders) in putting two hundred <hi>Voluntaries</hi> into order, and yet all labor loſt, nor was at any time ſeene to the number of fiftie that ſtood in their true places. I haue ſeene them alſo when they haue been to march into the field, ſo puſled for want of knowledge where to place themſelues or their vaſſals, and ſo offenſiue to the <hi>Generall,</hi> by an vndecent crowding and thronging about him, that the particular Officers of the field, as the <hi>Scout-maſters</hi> and <hi>Corporals</hi> of the field were neither able to approach to receiue direction, nor yet able to paſſe into the armie, to deliuer aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements, where had the company of
<hi>Voluntaries</hi> been competent and orderly, they might then haue bin inſtructed, that the beſt places had bin neereſt to the beſt perſons; and in caſes of attempts the likelieſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter and meet with the enemy. But how theſe may truly bee called <hi>Voluntaries,</hi> I know not: for euery one that is able to ſuite his bodie in rich clothes, vnleſſe he likewiſe apparell his minde in an obedient and formable faſhion, in neither worthy the name, priuiledges, nor reſpects which are due to men of this ſuppoſed Vertue. It is therefore to bee vnderſtood, that the noble
<hi>Voluntary</hi> indeed ought to be a man of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Iudgement, Noble in his carriage, and ready to giue all maner of<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14641:20"/>good examples: he ought to keepe a table at his owne charge, both for the entertainment of ſuch by whoſe diſcourſe he might reape profit, and alſo for an eaſe to the <hi>General,</hi> whoſe bounty might otherwiſe be ſtretcht vnto too high a reckoning: and to conclude, they ought to be but few in number, and thoſe of principall regard and eſtimation; for this fluxe is a torrent which drowneth and ouerwhelmeth both Diſcipline and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and from hence it hath come to paſſe, that I haue knowne diuers diſcreet Generals, which haue both proclaimed and inſerted in their Articles, that no man (of what condition ſoeuer) without his ſpeciall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, but vpon paine of death within ſuch a limitation of time ſhould either inroll himſelfe vnder ſome one or other Captaines colours, or elſe to depart from the Armie: by which meanes the multitude of <hi>Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> were leſſened, and none allowed but ſuch as were of the Generals owne election; a courſe queſtionleſſe full of great prouidence, for by that meanes many weake Troupes and Companies were made ſtrong, much diſorder was preuented, and a generall beauty &amp; grace was ſpread through the whole armie, no man hath receiued loſſe in his entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vnneceſſary checks haue been taken away, and the benefit of the <hi>Voluntaries</hi> bountie hath done good through the whole armie, where as to haue erected whole Troupes or new Companies onely of <hi>Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> if the State ſhould take exceptions thereat, and denie the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement, then muſt the Captaines vndergoe either checke and loſſe, or others meanes muſt be ſhortned to draw his within compaſſe.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue ſhewed the <hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>Honour,</hi> the <hi>Vſe,</hi> the <hi>Benefit,</hi> and the <hi>Offence</hi> of
<hi>Voluntaries,</hi> of which I know your Lordſhip in your owne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Experience haue had a ſufficient triall, ſo that to detaine you with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer Relation, were but to ouerdoe what I onely ſtriue to doe in the beſt perfection: and therefore I will here knit vp mine Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle with this Proteſtation, That if in it you will be pleaſd to diſcerne my loue, in that loue your Lordſhip ſhall euer finde an honeſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Seruice.</p>

               <p>This hath beene the auncient manner of leuying and rayſing Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in our Kingdome, nor doe I thinke that any wiſdome can finde out another way which can promiſe more equitie or faire dealing, eſpecially as long as the execution of theſe Commiſsions are performed by the Lieutenants themſelues who generally are great Princes, and men of that ſinguler vertue and goodnes that both the loue they beare their Countryes and the care they haue of their owne honors, makes them ſcorne to exprſſe either Spleene or Reuenge in ſo poore a buſines, But when theſe Commiſsions come out of their fingers and are diſperced vnto many, and amongſt them factions and diſſentions doe ariſe, then one ſtriues to defend one part, another another; one will ſhew his malice in thruſting forward, another his power in detayning backe, one will haue his reuenge ſatiſfied, another will haue his pitty admired; that to<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14641:21"/>conclude little equitie can be perceiued in their proceedings, and leſſe vertue ariſes from the fruits of their elections, for many times the decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and vnfit are pact'd to the warrs &amp; the able are kept at home, who laughing in their ſleeues pray for continuance of thoſe larrs by which he ſits at home and ſleepes out vexations; here might a man finde out many other grieuances, as the protections of liueryes, the friendſhip of bribes, and the ſuite of By-ſtanders, all which doe often make the King ill ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and beleeue it in caſes of great conſequence theſe perticular humors croſſe great deſignes; O how excellent were it, if in theſe common bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes men would ſet a part all priuate affections and but only regard the King and his ſeruice and ſtudy (as they ought) only the aduancement thereof, then ſhould we ſee (as <hi>Virgill</hi> ſaith) <hi>Pollio's</hi> returne and the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Age would be reſtored againe to vs and our Children; But this is <hi>O Vtinam,</hi> a wiſh that vaniſheth aſſoone as it is breathed, and therefore I could wiſh that in theſe Inferior Commiſsions which goe to a general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; their might be a mixt powre, that is to ſay; to the Commiſsioners and Captaines, and that ioyntly they would ſet a part all partiality, for the Commiſſioners which are Gouernors of the Country beſt know the eſtate thereof, and what is moſt wholeſome for the generall Body, (though of what belongs to the warres many of them are vtterly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant) and ſo the Captaine which beſt knowes what belongs to the warres and muſt with the hazard of his life lead thoſe men euen vnto the face of the enemie, he likewiſe may be vnskilfull in the wants of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; ſo that compounding an honeſt Body of them both there can be neither knowledge nor perfection wanting.</p>
               <p>Experience hath long time ſince taught me this, that when the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine is not in Commiſsion he may ſay and informe what hee pleaſeth, but the Commiſsioners will performe what they liſt, for they haue voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which will drowne him, and a deafeneſſe which hee cannot open; whereas bearing with them an equall authority, then his thunder muſt be as lowd, and being an honeſt man no leuye but will bee performed without wronge or diſparagement, and herein by all meanes theſe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines muſt not thinke too wel of themſelues, (ſcorning as it were) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their men, but ſending downe their inferior Officers, ſtay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues either at the Court to purſue ſome new hope, or in the Cittie to prouide new cloathes. Now that any other ſhould bee mixt with the Commiſsioners it is not fit nor is there any preſident; for though the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Officers may be diſcreete and honeſt, yet it is the Captaine (which is choſen by the Lords of the Kings Councell) which is probably ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Touching the leuyes of Souldiers which are made in the Countries and ſent away by <hi>Conductors,</hi> (which indeed ought to be men that know the warrs and liue with good fame and Reputation in their Countryes) I haue amongſt them obſerued much foule dealing, as firſt how they haue skimmed the Country of all the froathy, baſe and deboyſed Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which haue liued therein, then how they haue packt away all their<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14641:22"/>worſt Armes, &amp; laſtly how thoſe Conductors haue vnder the pretence of Sicknes &amp; infirmity for ſmall Bribes made ſale of the beſt of that lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Company; as if it had beene a kind of deadly ſin to haue brought any man with a good countenance in view of the Army; Nay beleeue it ſo pitifull haue I beheld the Regiments which they haue brought ouer, that like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> leane Kine they haue looked as if they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure all the fat in the Army; and ſurely had that Preacher ſeene them which preached in <hi>Kent</hi> before the Generalls of the <hi>Portugall</hi> action; he would againe &amp; againe thanked theſe Conductors, for carring away all the diſpiſed and baſe Raſcalls of the Nation.</p>
               <p>To conclude howſoeuer theſe errors &amp; corruptions haue crept in at ſome backedore (which humour or Couetouſneſſe hath ſet open) yet it is no fixed euill nor any generall infection, but like a

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing proceeded (my Lord) thus farre in my range of Militarie Intendments, and brought it paſt the leuie of mens perſons; which perſons as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound companies, ſo of thoſe Companies ariſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, &amp; of thoſe Regiments are made the whole and entire body of the Armie. It remaineth now that we come to a certaine diſtribution or diuiſion of theſe perſons, of which able I ſhall haue a more large occaſion to ſpeake in the next <hi>Decade;</hi> yet ſince here it falles ſo fit to my purpoſe, I will only diuide the Souldiers which haue beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly leuied into two ſorts, the one Shot, the other Pikes; and of the Shot we will ſuppoſe them to be either all, or (at leaſt) moſt part of them Muſquets, and the reſt Baſtard Muſquets, for Harquebuſſes I cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in this place, becauſe they are growne out of vſe, and can by no means make their encounter good where the Muſquet is oppoſed againſt them: for the one killing at twentie ſcore, the other hardly at ſix, how is it poſſible hee ſhould come to play within his diſtance, before all or the moſt part of the body be ouerthrowne and deſtroyed?</p>
               <p>Now for the election of the Bodies which are fitteſt to carry the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet they muſt be ſuch as are ſtrong, ſquare, and of a good, ſollid, &amp; well knit conſtitution: and for ſuch as are more weake, little, and nimble, to them the Baſtard-Muſquet may be put, for with a little vſe, and skilfull inſtruction they will be brought to order and mannage that peece with as great eaſe as either Harquebuſſe or Piſtoll.</p>
               <p>When thus a choice is made both of the man &amp; weapon, you ſhal then arme him after this manner, that is to ſay, vpon his head he ſhall weare<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14641:23"/>a good and ſufficient Spaniſh Morian well lined in the head with a quil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted cap of ſtrong linnen, and bound downe with lined eare-plates vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath his chinne; about his body Bautricke-wiſe, from the left ſhoulder and vnder the right arme he ſhall carrie a Bandiliere of broad Leather, or other richer ſtuffe (well ſtiffened) according to his abilitie, or the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Captaine; and to this Bandiliere ſhall bee faſtened by long double ſtrings (at leaſt a quarter of a yard in length a piece, that they may with more eaſe be brought to the mouth of the Muſquet) one large pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming charge made ſmall at the vpper end, and at leaſt twelue other char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, all made of ſome tough light wood, or elſe of horne, and couered with leather, but not of plate or leather entirely, for they are ſubiect to cruſhing &amp; bruiſing, and being once out of faſhion, they are hardly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, neither will they containe the powder in ſuch ample manner as formerly they did, of which the Souldior muſt be exceeding carefull: for euery charge muſt bee made fit to containe ſo much powder as will giue the peece her full lading, and neither more nor leſſe: for as ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging hazards the breaking of the Muſquet, ſo vndercharging makes her not able to carrie to the full randon. He ſhall alſo haue by his left ſide a good and ſufficient Sword with a basket hilt of a nimble and round proportion after the manner of the Iriſh; ſtrong Scabards of liquord or well roſend leather, Chapes of yron, and Girdles and Hangers ſutable to the ſame; as for the Blade, it ſhould be broad, ſtrong, and ſomewhat maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, of which the Turkie, or Bilboe are the beſt: at his girdle hee ſhall alſo carrie his Bullet bagge: in which hee ſhall beare his Moulds to caſt his Bullets: alſo his Wormes with which he ſhall cleare his peece when at any time it is cloid either by miſchance or ignorance, and his Screwes with which he ſhall vnlooſe euery vice-pinne or engine about the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, when he either intends to take it in peeces, or elſe to ſcowie it, to mend any thing that is out of frame, or otherwiſe to vnbreech it; and laſtly, he ſhall carrie in it his priming yron, being a ſmall artificiall wiar, with which he ſhall clenſe and keepe open the touch-hole of his peece, ſo as the priming powder may enter in and make the peece goe off vpon the firſt touch of any ſparke with which it encounters; all this perfitted, he ſhall bee armed with a good and very ſufficient muſquet, being of as neate and nimble a caſt as can bee made, prouided it bee ſtrong, cleane wrought, and of a good temper of yron, the Barrell muſt bee in length foure foot and a halfe, and the bore according to the ſize of a full Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, and tried by the gage or allowance of the Tower of London, the Stocke muſt be ſtraight, cleane and ſmoothe wrought, without knots or flawes in any part, but eſpecially towards the lower end, the extreameſt part at the nether end below the breech, ſhould be at leaſt eight inches in depth, flat and ſmoothe, ſo as if the peece happen a little to recoyle, yet it may not offend the Souldiers body, and the wood of which theſe Stockes are made, would be either good <hi>Wallnut-tree,</hi> good <hi>Peare-tree,</hi> or ſome other faſt, firme, and ſmoothe light wood, which is neither apt, through the ſhortneſſe of the graine quickly to breake, nor yet through
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14641:23"/>the largeneſſe to ſplit or riue in ſunder: you muſt haue regard that the barrell be ſmooth, euen, and not galled within, that it carry the full bore equally cleane throughout, and not carry Muſquet bore at the top, and hardly Harquebuſſe in the bottome? for it is an abuſe too frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our Gun-makers, and the effect is nothing elſe but deceit, and the peece of ſuch a bore is hardly ſo good as a Piſtoll<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſee that the pan be tight, and the touch-hole vnworne; for if it bee otherwiſe, the one will ſcatter and loſe the powder, the other will blow backe in the Souldiers face, or elſe recoyle and doe greater miſchiefe and on the contrary part, if the hole be too little, the powder will want paſſage, and the piece will hardly go off, without much toyle and great loſſe of labour: ſee that the breech be ſtrong and cloſe, all the ſcrewes and pinnes about it faſt and ſure, the ſcowring ſtick ſtraight, round, ſmooth, and headed with a ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of yron ſutable to the bore of the peece: let the Cocks and Tric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers be nimble to goe and come; for as concerning Seares they are vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly out of date, and the Inconueniences are found in our daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: for vpon euery motion or touch of the Souldiers garments, they are apt to make the piece flie off before there is occaſion, killing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times him that marcheth behind, ſometimes him that is before, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſets fire on him that beares it, and ſometimes wounds his Officer that comes to giue him direction; ſo that for theſe and the like miſchiefs they are vtterly forbidden, neither is the charge of a Tricker greater then that of a Seare; and whoſoeuer ſhall bee drawne to reformation, there wil be found little or no ods at all in the bargain, only the ſtupidity and blockiſhneſſe of our ignorant &amp; wilfull
<hi>Plebeians</hi> is ſo great, that but with huge difficultie they can neuer be brought to reliſh any alteration, eſpecially if there be but the value of one penny betwixt them and their firſt cuſtome, or that any debauſht fellow, who hath either runne from his Colours, beene an vnder-ſlaue to a Sutlers boy, and now for his laſt refuge keeps a Tipling houſe in the Countrey for men of his equall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: If he (I ſay) will but affirme what they ſurmiſe, it is not the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Neſtor,</hi> nor the experience of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> no not <hi>Apollos</hi> Oracle which is able to change any part of their reſolution: to this I haue been a pregnant witneſſe, and at this I haue often ſmiled, chiefly when I haue ſeene ſome of more eminent condition, how well they could be pleaſed to be flattered in their owne, yet a falſe opinion: But to returne againe to the arming of this Souldier, he ſhall haue for his right hand a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Reſt of Aſh or other light wood, with an yron pike in the nether end, and an halfe hoope of yron aboue to lay the Muſquet in when hee reſts it, and double ſtrong ſtrings ſhall be faſtened neere thereunto to put ouer the left arme, when at any time the Souldier ſhall haue occaſion to traile the ſame. Now as touching the length of theſe Reſts, there is not any certaine quantitie thereof; for howſoeuer generally they are foure foot and vpward, yet they ſhould be according to the ſtature of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which beares them, carrying the Muſquet ſo euen, that hee may in a comely manner diſcharge at a leuell without very much bending either<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14641:24"/>of his ſhoulders or bodie. Laſtly, if about his necke hee haue a piece of Buffe or quilted leather, cut in the proportion of a large Gorget, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the vttermoſt poynts of his ſhoulders, he ſhall finde both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and eaſe therby: for it will both ſaue his garments from wearing with the Muſquet, and alſo make the burthen leſſe and more eaſie.</p>
               <p>To conclude then, for the Baſtard Muſquet (which differeth nothing from the full Muſquet, but in the bore onely, and the charges which muſt be made ſutable to the bore) they are of excellent vſe, for they carrie as farre as the full Muſquet, and pearce as deepe (though their bore be leſſe) and their lightneſſe and nimbleneſſe to thoſe which are weaker, and of much leſſe abler bodies, is ſuch an eaſe and comfort, that they are able both to hold out in Marches and in Seruice with any man how ſtrong or potent ſoeuer. Now for their arming, it is in all poynts like that of the full Muſquet without any difference: for as their Seruice is alike, ſo alike are their Accoutrements, and what adornes the one, is as ſeemely and becomming for the other, ſo that it ſhall be needleſſe to wade further in this Diſcourſe, but leaue the reſt to the diſcretion of the Captaine in whoſe power it is to alter and diſpoſe of his Armes according to his owne will and the rule of his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince (my Lord) you are by his Maieſties fauor the Viceroy or Preſident of your Country, on whom all theſe Military actions depend, I cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded but any thing which comes cloathed with this Title (and carrying the Badge of experimented Truth) ſhall find from you a noble reſpect; for I know not any to reward vertue but vertue; nor any in theſe ſecure times that will looke on a Souldier but he that hath a daily vſe of his knowledge; if ſuch you Lordſhip looke for; this queſtionles will not hurt you, and how euer it want ſomething that you deſire, yet in the volume you ſhall find enough to giue an honeſt ſatisfacton.</p>
               <p>The courſe to which I am drawne in this Epiſtle is the manner of arming the <hi>Pike,</hi> which being the firſt and moſt principall weapon which guardeth an Armie, may challenge from euery Commander the ſeuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt reſpect in adorning thereof; I doe not meane the greater &amp; more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſort of perſons which ſerue with this weapon, but only the priuate and common Souldier, ſuch as make not vp one Fyle or one Ranke, but faſhion whole Bodyes and Groſſes of what quantitie ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>The perſons for this weapon are to be choſen out of the better ſort of men, ſuch as are tall, comely, actiue and valiant, yet in this choyce you are not ſo conſtantly to ſtand vpon proportion and outſide as diſcreetly to conſider the ſetled inclination of euery Souldier and to what armes by his owne nature he is principally adicted; In which Inquiſition, that you may be ſure not to faile, it is not amiſſe for euery Captaine to apply<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14641:25"/>his men vnto ſundry weapons and to that which he ſeeth him approach with the greateſt facility and delight, in that to ſtay him and incourage him; for ſo ſhall the Commander be beſt ſerued and the Souldier grow skilfull with the leaſt amaze and trouble. When therefore you haue attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a body anſwerable to the vſe and vertue of this weapon, you ſhall then arme him after this manner; vpon his head hee ſhall weare a good and ſufficient Spaniſh
<hi>Morian</hi> well lined within with a quilted Cap, of ſtrong huswiues linnen, for Buckram which is the vſuall lyning is too courſe and galleth the Souldiers head, as alſo it is too ſtiffe and vnplyable, by which meanes it will not quilt like the other; the eare plats ſhall bee lined alſo, and with a ſtring be made faſt vnder his neather chap, which will keepe the
<hi>Morian</hi> conſtantly vpon his head and breed leſſe trouble to the Souldier in the heare of encounters; The auncient cuſtome of arming the Pikemans head hath beene with a Burgonet, but the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, thereof hath beene found, for when the Burgonet is made faſt vnto the head, if in a charge the Enemie hit vpon the hye, broad Creſt which goeth thwart the crowne of the head (with the puſh of his Pike) then it is ten to one but hee either breaketh the Souldiers necke or at leaſt ouerthroweth him to the ground, or if to ſaue the hazard the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonet be looſe or the ſtring vnder the chappe breake, then he diſarmeth his head and ſo leaueth him in greate danger at euery encounter; And hence it is that all Burgonets are diſallowed and only the <hi>Morian</hi> or cloſe round cappe of ſteele with a ſmall welt on the top thought meete for the vſe of this Souldier.</p>
               <p>About his necke he ſhall haue a large, eaſie and well compaſt Gorget arming as cloſe to his doublet as is poſſible (prouided it pinch not) and ouer this Gordget vpon his body he ſhall caſt a payre of Curaces, that is to ſay the breaſt plate and backe part; which Curaces ſhall be of a nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and good mould, and faſhioned according to the neareſt, eaſieſt, and fitteſt apparell which is for a mans body, for though the variation of our apparell be Infinite and without either reaſon, meaſure or order, yet it is not meete that armes ſhould bee ſo changeable, but that rather a man ſhould frame his apparell to his Armes, then his Armes to his apparell for needle and thrid will doe the one, but fire and the hammer is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the other; theſe Curaces muſt be at leaſt hye Pike proofe for that is the allowance of our Nation; to bee greater is but burd'nous to the Souldier and bringeth neither eaſe nor profit; as for the leathers and Buckles with which informer times this Armor was faſtned about the Souldier, they ſhall now be neglected, and inſtead thereof euery ſeuerall member of the Armour ſhall be made faſt about them with Claſpes of Iron, hooked or pinned together either with hookes or cleft pinnes of Braſſe or Iron; for the leathers at euery encounter are ſoone cut in pieces, but theſe neuer, at the neather part of his Breaſt-plate hee ſhall haue a payre of faire lardge <hi>Taces;</hi> reuited in ſundry Ioynts and made in ſuch true compaſſe that they may arme cloſe all the Belly and forepart of the Souldier euen downe to his midde thigh; vpon his ſhoulders hee<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14641:25"/>ſhall haue a large payre of well moulded Pouldrons which ſhall arme him from the top of the Shoulder down to the Elbow. But as, touching the Vantbrace (which armeth from the elbow to the hand) they are not greatly materiall in this caſe, neither are they reſpected or required in our Muſters. It is true that the Pouldrons and Taces are many times like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neglected, the firſt becauſe it hindreth a little the vſe of the arme, the latter becauſe of the burthen and ſome hiderances in ſwift marches, but in as much as they are ſtill required by all our ſupreame Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and that the benefit farre exceedeth the trouble, therefore in this diſcourſe I muſt giue them all poſſible allowance; Laſtly all theſe ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts of Armor is rather to bee of a Ruſſet or blacke collour then mil'd, for they are leaſt perceiued in the night, are fitteſt for ſecret Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcadoes and preſerueth it ſelfe the longeſt time from Ruſt and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>In his right hand he ſhall haue a ſtronge, ſtraight, yet nimble Pike made of a well growne Aſhe, and headed with a Pike of ſteele, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo armed with plates of Iron downeward from the head at leaſt foure or ſixe foote deepe vpon the ſtaffe: the Pike ſhall bee in length full fifteene foote beſides the head, It hath beene an auncient Cuſtome to arme Pikes in the mid'ſt (Iuſt in that place where the Souldier ſhall carry it when hee either marcheth or ſhouldereth it) either with cloathe, veluet, ſilke or other ſtuffe (either according to fancy or in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the Captaines Colours) for the ſpace of eighteene Inches or thereabouts, but by reaſon of ſome ſuggeſtyons againſt it, as nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the worme, fretting the Pike with duſt and ſuch like; it is now not ſo much reſpected, yet in that I know it is comely to the eye, and ſome helpe to the younge Souldier in ſhewing him the true place where he ſhall carry his Pike in Marching, Shouldering, Sloaping and the like, I will therefore leaue it to the diſcretion of euery Commander, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my ſelfe that howſoeuer curioſſity may repine, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iudgement may make it tollerable.</p>
               <p>The Pikeman ſhall haue by his left ſide a good, ſharpe and broad Sword, (of which the Turkye or Bilboe are the beſt) the length of the blade being a full yard and one inch, the hilt of Basket faſhion, round and well compaſt, the ſcaberd of ſtrong leather, chapt with Iron, and to carry his Sword either Girdle &amp; Hangers of ſtrong leather, or broad Bautrickes of the ſame ſubſtance, but Hangers are the beſt if they be ſide and large, eſpetially when hee ſhall come to receiue the encounter or charge of Horſe, where couching his body downe low with the bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Pike, the Bautrick girdle (being looſe) is apt to fall (by the poyze of the Sword) in a troubleſome manner before him, ſo as he ſhall neither readily draw it out, nor nimbly vſe his Pike by reaſon that his Sword will hange dangling before him. There be ſome that except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the perfixed and certaine length of the Sword, alleadgeing that all weapons ſhould be accommodated to the fitneſſe of the perſon, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſhorter arme the longer Sword and the longer arme the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14641:26"/>weapon) and not be bound to a generall diſaduantage: but howeuer there doth appeare ſome reaſon herein, yet is the diſtinction ſomewhat too nice, for if the ſhort arme bee allowed the long ſword, will not the long arme (who hath equall choyce) bee owner of the like wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon; where is then the ſhort armes aduantage? and ſo againe by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing from the contrary you ſhall find, that no difference in body ought to make a difference in weapons, but there ſhould euer remaine a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant preſident, although now and then it may bee varyed at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders diſcretion, and ſuer, then that ſize formerly expreſſed, there cannot be a better limmit.</p>
               <p>Laſtly if to the Pikemans <hi>Morion</hi> be faſtned a ſtrong ring of yron, and to the right ſide of his backepiece below his girdle, an yron hooke to hange the <hi>Morion</hi> vpon, it will be a great eaſe for the Souldier, and a nimble Cariage in the time of long Marches; for there is not any thinge more grieuous to a man then ouer heating of his head, neither haue I at any time found a quicker cauſe for ſicknes and diſtemper. Thus I haue deliuered the moſt ſubſtantiall and perfecteſt way of armeing an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Pikeman or common Souldier, ſuch as may paſſe borh ours or any other indifferent Muſter. And though buſie Apprehenſions might find out many other curioſſities and niceties to adde to this relation, yet in as much as I know they will but rather offend
<hi>Patience,</hi> then better <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> I am willing to let them remaine ſtill in the bottome of their owne Ocean, and if any man will find them let him ſound for them, for mine owne part I only ſerue
<hi>Truth,</hi> and to her I dare bringe no Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice but a conſtant
<hi>Experience.</hi>

               <head>THE ARGVMENT. <hi>Of the Souldiers Oath and Diſtribution.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue (my Lord) in the former <hi>Decad</hi> intreated of the choice and election of the common Souldier belonging to the Infantrie or foot Companies, and how to arme both the Muſquet and Pike, which are all the weapons generally vſed in our Moderne warres, and of which indeed hee is onely capable: for to other weapons doe belong other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and they are either put into the hands of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Officers, or elſe vnto Gentlemen of Companies, as the <hi>Partizan,</hi> the <hi>Halbert,</hi> the <hi>Target,</hi> and the like. It now reſteth that I proceed to the other duties of a common Souldier, of which none is more eminent and neceſſarie then his Oath; for it not onely bindeth him to Obedience, which is the principall linke in all martiall Diſcipline; but is alſo ſuch a pledge betwixt God and his Conſcience, that whenſoeuer the deuill or malice aſſaults him, it like a ſtrong Bulwarke ſtands betweene, and beats the battery backe euen to the ſeducers deſtruction.</p>
               <p>When therefore an Armie is raiſed, it then reſteth that an Oath be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to the common Souldier for his fidelitie, which the Antients found exceeding neceſſarie in diuers reſpects, for although the ſeueritie of the Lawes were a Bit ſharp enough &amp; ſtrong enough to curbe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the furie of any wild or vntamed ſpirit, either from
<hi>Diſloyalty, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,</hi> or any treacherous <hi>Practiſe</hi> whatſoeuer: yet hath experience found out that the Soldier who by a continual familiaritie with affright and dangers, is growne aduenturous, hardie, and valiant, and by gazing death in the face at euery houre and ſeaſon, and almoſt in euery attempt<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14641:27"/>which he either doth or ſuffers, ſo that hee reputes him no more but a word, a toy, or an idle ſhadow, and will many times with as great ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie daunce and runne poſt to the gallowes, as Vertue would flie to a glorious action, that therefore another chaine muſt bee found out, whoſe linkes being ſmoother, ſmaller, and more cunningly and cloſely compact together, though they doe not bruiſe, hurt, or nip, yet they ſhould binde faſter, ſtronger, and with greater aſſurance, then any terror of death or bodily torment whatſoeuer; and this was an Oath, which calling God to be a witneſſe of his Loyaltie and Faith, doth ſo knit and make faſt his Conſcience to an honeſt meaning, that hauing any true ſparke of Chriſtianitie within him, no motion can ariſe to infringe or violate the ſame, but preſently his Conſcience hath Arguments to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it, and his Reſolution as a moſt valiant
<hi>Chiefe,</hi> tramples and treads it downe as a thing peſtilent and noyſome to his Fame and Honour, for howſoeuer a Souldier feares not death, yet hee expects Ioy after death, and whatſoeuer thruſtes betwixt him and that hope, is his mortall enemie.</p>
               <p>The words of this Oath are various and incertaine, nor is there any conſtant Preſident thereof, but it hath its limitation, according to the purpoſes of the <hi>Generall,</hi> and the neceſſitie or occaſions of the action, being contained in a certaine Booke or Scedule of Articles which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe all the Souldiers duties in the Warre both towards <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Generall,</hi> and euery other Officer or Chiefe, commaunding within the Armie, all which (when the Souldiers are muſtered, and gathered together) ſhall in ſolemne wiſe bee openly read vnto them by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Notarie of the Armie, which finiſhed hee ſhall ſpeake vnto them thus, or to the like purpoſe.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>BRethren, and Companions in Armes, you haue heard the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our King, containing the principall Lawes of the Field, and the Oath which euery Souldier ſhould take; All you that intend faithfully to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the ſame, let him now either openly refuſe to bee a Souldier, or elſe hold vp his hand, and ſay after mee: All theſe Articles which haue beene read, we hold ſacred and good, and will valiantly and truely fulfill the ſame. So helpe vs God, and his diuine Word. Amen.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>This is the effect and manner of the Souldiers oath, and it ought to be performed with the greateſt Solemnitie that may be, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the <hi>Generall,</hi> the <hi>Lieutenant Generall,</hi> or the
<hi>Maſter de Campo,</hi> at the leaſt. This oath hath ſometimes been deliuered without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the latter words by the Souldiers, but onely by holding vp of their hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is as much and as forcible: as if they ſhould lay their hands on a Booke, for it is the conſent which maketh ſtrong the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, and bindeth the Conſcience both before God and man.</p>
               <p>The Souldier being thus ſworne, it remaineth then to make a true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution or vſe of them; In which it is to be vnderſtood, that all Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14641:27"/>are of two ſorts, as either of the
<hi>Cauallerie,</hi> which is ſeruing on horſebacke, or of the
<hi>Iufantery,</hi> which is ſeruing on foot, and betweene theſe there hath bin held a tedious difference touching prioritie of place, and precedencie in eſtimation, ſome allowing it to the <hi>Horſman,</hi> ſaying He is more worthie, more puiſſant, more ſwift, more dexter, and more ſeruiceable, that a Horſeman may at his pleaſure be a footman, but a Footman not <hi>(A conuerſo)</hi> at his pleaſure be a Horſeman, that the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is more fit for all ſorts of imployments, that he diſcouereth things a farre off, and ſubdueth whatſoeuer is neere at hand, that he performeth three duties at one inſtant, namely that of the <hi>Launce,</hi> that of the
<hi>Sword,</hi> and that of the <hi>Fire,</hi> which no Footman can doe, that he hath alwayes a Gentlemans place, and a Gentlemans entertainment, that for the moſt part he hath euer ſome one or other attendant, man or boy, to wait vpon him, and to conclude, that no Footman whatſoeuer but holdeth it a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Aduancement to be made an Horſeman. Now there are others which affirme, that the Footman is more noble, ſaying, that he is as nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the other is puiſſant; that he can with leſſe difficultie anſwer an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum or a charge, that hee marches as ſurely (though not as ſpeedily) that he is able either to make good or aſſaile all Aſſaults and Breaches, that he can ſcale wals and Towers, beat Trenches, Mines and Ditches, and indeed ſet his foot and conquer where no Horſe is able to approach; that he firſt poſſeſſeth Townes, Cities and ſtrong holds, and onely from his bountie giueth to the Horſman the benefit of his Quarter; that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the Horſeman be much ſwifter then he, yet when they come into any Straits, as <hi>Paces, Lanes, Mountaines,</hi> or the like, that then the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is in a fatall and deſperat danger, if the Footman make not his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage good; that the Footman in his trauel, though he cannot boaſt of the Horſemans eaſe, yet when he comes to his iourneys end, hee wants all the Horſemans trouble, for hee hath no Forrage to ſeeke out, no Stable roome to prouide, nor no horſe to dreſſe, hee ſaith, that multiplicitie of attendants, are multiplicitie of charges, and when he drawes any ſuch thing vnto him, it is for his pleaſure, not neceſſitie: and to conclude, the charge of a Horſeman is ſo great, that it containeth the valew of tenne Foot, yet one Foot according to the computation of all manner of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments is as auaileable and neceſſarie as any Horſeman. Thus they argue one againſt the other; but the reſolution of the doubt is, that the greateſt number or principall ſtrength whereof the armie doth conſiſt, that to it the prioritie of place is to be giuen: and hence it comes, that with vs here in
<hi>England,</hi> both in the old &amp; firſt times, when our Browne-Bill men and Archers made vp the Body, ſtrength and perfection of the armie, and that the Horſe were but ſmall handfuls, and now in theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent daies when the Pike and Muſquet are the very matter on which our Armies doe conſiſt, the Footmen hath the chiefeſt honour and glory of our Conqueſts, and the firſt place or ranke is ſo duely his, that our Kings and Generals in the ancient battels haue beene ſeene (when the Armies haue ioyned) to allight from their horſes, and put themſelues into the<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14641:28"/>midſt of the maine battell of Foot: But on the contrary part, in <hi>France,</hi> where the people are much more nice and delicate, and not ſo able as ours to indure long and tedious Marches, they doe for the moſt part all mount themſelues on horſebacke: ſo that their Armies haue and do euer moſt conſiſt of Horſe, and the Horſeman is he that hath the greateſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus reconciled this diſputation betweene the
<hi>Cauallarie</hi> and <hi>Infantrie,</hi> it is the great Souldiers Office to diſtribute his men into theſe diuiſions according to the neceſſitie of his affaires, and the abilitie of mens perſons, appointing ſome to be Horſmen, and ſome to be footmen: which done, he ſhall ſubdeuide his Horſemen according to his abilitie in Armes, the cuſtome of Countries, and the accommodation of the place wherein they are to ſerue, making ſome
<hi>Launciers,</hi> and ſome <hi>Piſtollers,</hi> ſome
<hi>Light-Horſemen,</hi> and ſome <hi>Carbines,</hi> for all theſe are neceſſary in an Army, hauing their diſtinct and ſeuerall places, ſeuerall Seruice, and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times and ſeaſons, as ſhall bee ſhewed more largely when I come to intreat of their ſeuerall ſubiects.</p>
               <p>The Footmen likewiſe ſhall alſo bee ſubdiuided according to their talneſſe in ſtature, their ſtrength of body, and nimbleneſſe in action, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome Pike-men, ſome Halberdiers, and ſome Targetiers, ſome Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, ſome Baſtard-Muſquets, and ſome Harquebuſſes, according as your ability of Armes are able to prouide, for although it were to bee wiſht that all the ſhot of the <hi>Infantry</hi> might bee full Muſquets, yet if the quantitie be wanting, you muſt then ſupply it as neere the qualitie as can be, and rather then leaue a man vnfurniſhed, let him haue Baſtard-Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, Harquebuſſe, nay the old Engliſhmans loſt weapon, a good ſtrong Bowe and Arrowes.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue ſhewed your Lordſhip in this briefe Epiſtle the effect and manner of the Souldiers Oath, and the generall diſtribution of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wherein if I haue not handled euery poynt with that exact fulneſſe which a diligent capacitie would require, it muſt bee conceiued that my iourney is long and intricate, and I ſhall touch at one and the ſame thing in diuers places; ſo that whatſoeuer is darke or obſcure here, ſhall receiue ſufficient light in another Epiſtle: Bee your Lordſhip then pleaſed (in whom I haue euer found an honourable reſpect, and to whom I haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer been bound for many noble fauours) to looke ouer theſe rude-diſge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted lines; and when they haue ſpoken as much as belongs to their meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, thinke they would onely intimate this more, that the Writer loues you, and that loue ſhall euer make him ready to ſerue you.</p>

               <p>After the <hi>Corps de guard</hi> (which is a Squadron of ſome fiue and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or thirty perſons) is drawne fourth (whether it be in Campe or in Gariſon) &amp; placed where the Enemy is apteſt to make his approaches, preſently the Serieant, Corporall, or other Officer which hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Corps de guard</hi> ſhall out of the common Souldiers drawe his <hi>Sentinell,</hi> &amp; conduct him thirty or forty paces from the

<hi>Corporall, Corporall;</hi> to which the <hi>Corporall</hi> ſhall replie
<hi>Holla,</hi> and ſo preſently come away and with his Sword drawne receiue the word from the paſſenger whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he be: thus ſhall the

The
<hi>Sentinell</hi> is a man of ſo meane truſt that in our Armies he is not credited with the watch-word, but only like the <hi>Roman</hi> Gooſe muſt cry out and exclaime when the Capitall is in danger, he is a man that muſt wraſtle and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facce any extreamity, not reſpecting the cruelty of any ſeaſon, nor leaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hit Station either for Froſt, Snow, Haile, Thunder or Tempeſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Sentinels</hi> in caſe of ordinary attendance as in quiet Gariſons or where the Enemie is farre off remooued, there they may ſtand ſingle and alone, but if it be in a Seidge, or in Campes where the Enemie lies neare one to another, there by all meanes they ſhall ſtand double, that is to ſay two, one a little diſtance from the other, yet in ſuch ſort that they may diſcerne one another, and be aſſiſting each to other, vſing all the diligence that may be both of Eies and Eeares, and being both as ſilent as the dead of night it ſelfe. If the weather be violently cold and piercing, one of them may walke whilſt the other doth watch: if it bee extreame darke one of them may with his eare lie &amp; liſten to the ground whilſt the other lookes about to ſee if any thing doe approach him, and thus one may helpe the other, ſo that nothing can paſſe without the verdge of their knowledge. Now if it happen (as many times it doth) that there be <hi>Sentinell</hi> beyond <hi>Sentinell</hi> one ſtanding at leaſt thirty or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty paces nearer to the Enemie then the other; then ſhall that which ſtandeth neareſt to the Enemy be a ſingle
<hi>Sentinell,</hi> the other ſhall bee double, and when the ſingle
<hi>Sentinell</hi> perceiueth any approach of troops or companies then ſhall he retire to the double to declare his diſcouery; and when all three perceiueth it then they may giue the alarme. And herein is to be noted that all
<hi>Settinels</hi> in generall whatſoeuer they bee, ought not in any wiſe to acknowledge any man of what degree or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſoeuer the be: were it his Captaine or any other Officer of the Campe, but to keepe him out at a full diſtance till the word bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>

This <hi>Sentinell</hi> may not in any wiſe haue the word, becauſe of the great perill in which he ſtandeth of ſurpriſing &amp; being taken Priſoner, whereby the word may be inforced from him and his whole party brought within the compaſſe of moſt certaine deſtruction, yet notwithſtanding although the word be detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from him, it is very conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that he haue a different counter-ſigne by which he may be knowne and receiued when at any time he hapneth to returne, and againe if he doe happen to come off with ſafety, he muſt be wondrous carefull that all his relations and informations be moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine &amp; true, for to be either ſo far tranſported with feare that he cannot diſtinguiſh ſounds; or ſo dull with amazement that his eies cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerne conſtant and cleere obiects, by which meanes he giues a confuſed Intelligence, there is nothing but diſhonor which will redound to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and loſſe &amp; hinderance to thoſe vnto whom he would tender al his beſt endeauors, &amp; like <hi>Conſidius</hi> who (imployd in theſe affaires) by a miſtake of his eyes and bringing vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi> a falſe and contrary meſſage, made in one moment a ſhipwracke of that Fame and Reputation, which<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14641:30"/>he had beene thirty yeares in gaining both vnder
<hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Craſſus:</hi> for all other ordinary
<hi>Sentinels</hi> of which I ſpake in the former part of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, being thus but in the firſt degree of a common Souldier; there is from them expected no more but common duties, neither is there any more truſt or affiance in them then neceſſity inforceth, but if he be a man of valor, wiſdome, apprehenſion, care &amp; obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhewing in himſelfe an abilitie both to doe and indure, there is no doubt but his Captaine (except he be too much vnthankefull) will take notice of his vertues and quickly aduance him to better eſtimation. The <hi>Sentinell</hi> and whole <hi>Corps de guard</hi> ſhall march to their place of watch armed at all parts according to the right belonging to the weapon he carieth, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing thoſe which had the watch before them, ſhall performe their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties withall ſecreſie and ſilence. Of theſe <hi>Sentinels</hi> there would be at leaſt twenty in euery Squadron: for vpon many occaſions many are ſet forth, and being but relieued three or foure times in a night, yet euery one will haue worke enough and no mans hand ſhal be empty. It hath beene an argument with ſome that the Rounder paſſing within eight or ten paces of the <hi>Sentinell,</hi> that he may paſſe by with a Salute only, without giuing the word, &amp; that the <hi>Sentinell</hi> may permit and ſuffer the ſame, but it is an erronious opinion and doth not agree with good diſcipline, for hee that is one of the eies of the Armie and vtterly fordidden during his time of watch to acknowledg any creature whatſoeuer, whether he come from the Campe or from the Towne, from the friend or from the enemie, for wayes &amp; paſſages in the night doe not diſtinguiſh perſons, he that ſtands to guard ſtands to ſuſpect, and the tolleration of one eſcape may draw on a million.</p>
               <p>If the formoſt ſingle <hi>Sentinell</hi> ſhall ſtay any paſſenger, he ſhal neither call his Corporall nor demand of him the word, but hauing ſtaid him, he ſhal bring him to the double <hi>Sentinell</hi> and they ſhall call the Corporall who ſhall receiue it. To conclude this Epiſtle, it hath beene the manner of the Spaniſh diſcipline in their warrs to let the <hi>Sentinell</hi> haue the word, ſo that he doth receiue it both of the Rounders and other paſſengers; but how dangerous &amp; hurtfull it hath beene vnto them, that exployt of <hi>Sir Roger Williams</hi> (of noble memory) and <hi>Sir Martin Skinke</hi> (when they attempted their paſſage to <hi>Venlow</hi>) will moſt worthily witnes, where in ſtead of giuing the word they tooke the word and ſlew the <hi>Sentinels,</hi> and made their paſſage good euen to the Tent of the <hi>Generall</hi> (the noble Duke of
<hi>Parma</hi>) whom they made flie out of his bedde in his ſhirt, and had they not had other ends which did guid them, it was ſuppoſed at that inſtant they might haue taken him priſoner; This I ſhew that to this inferior place ſhould be attributed no greater priuiledge then is conuenient, for being the meaneſt amongſt the meaneſt, it is enough if their eies and eares doe their duties, for their tongues it is too nimble an engine, and ſhould be laden with no more poyze then it might beare without either trouble or danger.</p>

               <p>The word <hi>Ronda,</hi> which both in Spaniſh and Italian doth ſignifie a Rounder, is taken in the plurall number for a certaine ſelect company of Gentlemen, or well deſeruing Souldiers, who for the merit of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice (expreſt in their valour and obedience, and the honeſt and faithfull performance of thoſe inferiour duties which are liable to the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of euery common Souldier) haue beene aduanced by their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from the title of a common man to be a Gentleman of a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, the priuiledge whereof doth not onely free and diſcharge him from the humble and meaner duties, as that of the <hi>Sentinell,</hi> and the like, but
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14641:31"/>doth alſo exhauſt and raiſe vp his entertainement, therein making a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene them and the vulgar perſons, and theſe be called Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen <hi>Rounders,</hi> or Gentlemen of the
<hi>Round,</hi> whoſe dutie and office is to viſit the <hi>Corps du guards,</hi> the <hi>Sentinels, Scouts</hi> &amp; <hi>Watches</hi> at ſundry houres in the night, to cauſe them to obſerue the lawes, ſtatutes, and ordinances of the armie, and to ſee whether they bee vigilant and ready ſo as no ſurpriſe, Sally, priuate Iniury, or other ſecret Stratagem be wrought or performed againſt the body of the Armie; and for this cauſe they walke continually round about from <hi>Sentinell</hi> to <hi>Sentinell,</hi> and from Guard to Guard. If it be in a Garriſon round about the walles of the towne, and if in a Campe, then round about the fortification thereof either within or without, and through euery paſſage which approcheth to the ſame, by meanes of which circular courſe or round walke which they vndertake, they haue the name of <hi>Rounders,</hi> or a Gentleman of the
<hi>Round.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are in the immediate next degree before the
<hi>Sentinell,</hi> and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the Captaine hath power in his owne company to diſpence with places and duties of this nature; yet in true &amp; ſeuere diſcipline this place was firſt allotted for yong Gentlemen of good Blood and diſcent, who deſirous to aduance their fortunes in the warres, haue (for pay) thruſt themſelues vnder the commands of ſundry Captaines, for whoſe encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and reſpect both this place and dutie, and an aduancement of ſome greater pay (then that to a common Souldier) was inſtituted and ordeined; and queſtionles there is great reaſon there ſhould be ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betweene them and the vulgar: And although for knowledge ſake it is ſometimes a glory vnto them to ſtand
<hi>Sentinell,</hi> yet it muſt bee out of their voluntary motion: for no conſtraint ought to inforce them thereunto. Theſe Gentlemen as they are
<hi>Rounders</hi> are truſted with the <hi>Word,</hi> which no
<hi>Sentinel</hi> may be; they are the leaders or Captains of Files in the company wherin they ſerue, and may challenge the moſt honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble places in all Marches, &amp; ſuch as are the moſt likely to come to the firſt encounter of the enemy; they may challenge now and then entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at the Captains own table, and being without diſparagement, of cleare blood and vertue, euen the General himſelfe ſhould not contemne them; and doubtles, theſe extraordinary graces doe infinitely oblige thankfull minds; and in caſes of Mutiny or any other priuate diſorder, doe much ſtrengthen the Commander, for being right Gentlemen, &amp; of ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, they will euer haue in the company ſome to depend vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo that howſoeuer miſchiefes runne, they will commonly haue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, aſſuredly the better part to adhere vnto them; and indeed it ought to be their ſtudy, that as they are reſpected aboue the vulgar, ſo they ſhould excell the vulgar in the vertues of <hi>Fidelity, Valour, Secrecy, Patience, Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> and <hi>Continence,</hi> and as others ſerue for gaine, ſo they muſt ſerue for Glorie and aduancement.</p>
               <p>Now to deſcend to the particular duty of the <hi>Rounder,</hi> he ought firſt to ſet the watch either in company or in ſquadron, whether it be in Gariſon or in the field, &amp; to march with his fellowes in Armes to the place where<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14641:31"/>the <hi>Corps du guard</hi> is appointed, and there to place himſelfe in a comely and ſilent manner till the
<hi>Corporall</hi> haue ſet out all his <hi>Sentinels,</hi> and that the firſt round is gone about, which ought to be performed by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Watch himſelfe or ſome other ſupreme Officer, then after ſome ſmall pauſe, the Captain, Lieutenant, Serieant, or Corporall which hath the charge of the <hi>Corps du guard,</hi> ſhall call foorth two Gentlemen
<hi>Rounders</hi> (for it is to be vnderſtood that they ought euer for the moſt part to go double and not ſingle) and to theſe in very ſilent manner hee ſhall deliuer the <hi>Word,</hi> giuing them great charge of care and ſecreſie therein, and ſo forthwith they ſhal paſſe away vpon the <hi>Round,</hi> with ſuch ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Armes as they vſually carry, which for the moſt part is the Pike, for that is accounted the Gentlemans weapon. Now being on vpon the <hi>Round,</hi> they muſt with a very curious eye, and a quicke eare obſerue any cauſe of danger bee it neuer ſo light, they muſt take a ſuruey of all Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers, bulwarks, trenches &amp; mines whatſoeuer they encounter with, and behold if they can perceiue any thing dangerous about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; according to the brightnes or obſcurnes of the aire, ſo muſt their vigilance be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented; for if it be clear &amp; light, then muſt their eies be their beſt Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cers; if it be cloudy, dark &amp; vnperceiuable, then muſt their eares inform them, and they muſt diuers times ſtand ſtill and liſten whether they can heare any ſpeech or conference, and obſerue of what conſequence &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the words are; alſo if they can heare any trampling of horſes fect, any claſhing of armors, or if they can diſcern any glimpſe of fire or ſparklings of Marches, and the like: any of which when they perceiue, they ſhall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceale themſelues till it approch them that they may diſcouer it, or elſe draw as neere vnto it as they can with conuenience, and if they find eminent danger, either retire and giue notice, or els raiſe the alarme, but if it be in caſe of equality, then by calling &amp; receiuing the
<hi>Word,</hi> giue paſſage, or otherwiſe for want therof take them priſoners, &amp; bring them to the Guard; but vpon any reſiſtance, then it is lawfull to kill as being an enemy, but not otherwiſe. Thus paſſing along vpon the <hi>Round,</hi> when they come vnto the <hi>Sentinels,</hi> they muſt make their approches with all the art and cunning that can be deuiſed, and with all ſilence ſtealing neere vnto them, watch whether they be aſleep, or whether they ſtand careleſly out of order, &amp; not vpon their guard: they ſhall by perſwaſion, intiſement or inſinuation trie if they can come within them, if they can take their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons from them, or if they will admit them to paſſe by without calling their <hi>Corporall</hi> (as knowing that they are Gentlemen of their Company, and of their familiar acquaintance) or the like careles eſcapes, which they ſhall put to the vttermoſt triall, then they ſhal preſently call the <hi>Corporal,</hi> to whom declaring their negligence and offence, another <hi>Sentinel</hi> ſhall be forthwith placed, and the offending one caried to the Guard ſhall by his ſuperior officer receiue ſeuere &amp; condigne puniſhment. The reaſons of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery which attempt I forbeare to ſet downe, becauſe they would but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerburden ſo ſhort an Epiſtle; and no man (I hope) that ſhall happen vpon this diſcourſe, will haue ſo ſhallow an vnderſtanding as not to conceiue<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14641:32"/>how dangerous the leaſt of theſe eſcapes may prooue to the body of an Army. It hath bin a queſtion whether the Gentlemen
<hi>Rounders</hi> may wink at theſe offences, and only by giuing ſharp admoniſhment to the <hi>Sentinel,</hi> or peraduenture a drie blow or two conceale it from his ſuperior officer: but it is moſt certaine that they may not, but in dutie ought truely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale vnto him all materiall things whatſoeuer which hath hapned vnto them in going of the Round: But if in the Round they find all things wel, and to their contentment, and that the
<hi>Sentinels</hi> are vigilant and carefull, ſo as nothing can eſcape or paſſe by them, then when the <hi>Sentinel</hi> ſhal ſay <hi>Quiva la,</hi> or <hi>Who goes there?</hi> the <hi>Rounder</hi> ſhall reply, <hi>A Friend:</hi> when the <hi>Seutinell</hi> ſhall ſay <hi>Stand,</hi> the
<hi>Rounder</hi> ſhall anſwer, <hi>Call your Corporall;</hi> then when the
<hi>Corporall</hi> approcheth, the <hi>Rounder</hi> ſhall in his eare deliuer the word with all ſecrecy, which being true, the <hi>Corporall</hi> ſhall ſay, <hi>Paſſe along;</hi> and ſo the <hi>Rounder</hi> ſhall depart to the next <hi>Sentinell,</hi> and in that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from <hi>Sentinell</hi> to
<hi>Sentinell</hi> till he haue gone round about, and be come to his owne
<hi>Corps du guard</hi> againe.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Rounders</hi> in paſſing the Round ſhall encounter with other <hi>Roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> then they which firſt diſcouer, ſhall firſt call, and firſt challenge the <hi>word,</hi> but if both diſcouer at one inſtant, &amp; as it were call in one moment, then they ſhall enterchangeably both giue and receiue the <hi>word,</hi> that is to ſay, that <hi>Rounder</hi> which receiueth the <hi>word,</hi> his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion to the contrary partie ſhal giue the <hi>word,</hi> ſo that on both ſides the <hi>word</hi> ſhalbe both giuen and taken, one of each party hauing the ſwords point at his boſome, for whoſoeuer receiueth the <hi>word,</hi> muſt draw his ſword, and he that deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it, muſt tender againſt it his boſome; for the maner of the encounter it is thus; the firſt diſcouerer calleth <hi>Qui-va-la,</hi> the other reply <hi>The Round;</hi> the firſt anſwereth the <hi>Round</hi> alſo: then they meet a little diſtance aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and hee that firſt diſcouered, receiues the
<hi>word,</hi> and his Companion giues it, and ſo <hi>à conuerſo.</hi> Now if the <hi>Rounders</hi> be ſent out ſo early in the night that they meet the Captaine of the watch (who ſhould go the firſt Round) then of him they muſt take notice, &amp; both one after another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer him the <hi>word,</hi> and ſo doing reuerence, paſſe along. To conclude and finiſh vp this dutie of the <hi>Rounder,</hi> if they ſhall in their round meet either with the <hi>Generall</hi> of the Army, or the
<hi>Gouernour</hi> of the garriſon vndiſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and like himſelfe in all parts both of perſon and attendants, ſo that without excuſe they muſt know him, then to him they ſhal giue the <hi>word</hi> alſo, but to no other whatſoeuer (more then ſuch as are before ſpecified) no not to his owne Captaine, nor to the Captaine of the watch, after the firſt Round is performed: and of theſe <hi>Rounders</hi> there muſt bee at leaſt two or more in euery Squadron, who performing this dutie twice or thrice euery night, or as neceſſity ſhall requier, will no doubt both keepe the Watches in good order, &amp; bring much ſafetie to the Armie. In ſome places they haue Round houſes, where the Captaine of the watch and all the <hi>Rounders</hi> together remaine all night, who ſetteth out his <hi>Rounders</hi> each halfe houre or houre, according to the ſpace of the Round.</p>

               <p>The Clerke ſhall (as conuenient leaſure will ſuffer him) once in a weeke reade to the whole Company the Lawes and Articles of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; and if there be no Miniſter or Preacher about them, he ſhall at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient times, (as at the ſetting of the watch or breaking vp of the ſame) reade diuine prayers vnto them.</p>
               <p>He ſhall receiue from the Treaſurer or vnder-treaſurer, all the pay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Captaine and Souldiers, and ſee faithfully and truely diſtributed to euery man his due according to the Captaines directions, and he ſhal keepe a faithfull Audit between the Captaine and all others, clearing euery reckoning without doubt or diſorder, hee is to receiue from the victualer all proportions of victuals, &amp; to keep a due account of the prizes thereof, he is to receiue all Prouaunt Apparell, with the value of the ſame, and he is to receiue all manner of Munition and Armes which is neceſſary for the whole Company, and of all theſe hee ſhall keepe true records, fetch out the Certificates and kepe all reckonings e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen betweene his Captaine and all Officers. This Clerke is hee which ought to be both the Companies Phiſition and the Companies Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, for he ought by Information to the Captaine and by his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to prouide all things neceſſary for them, both in ſickneſſe and in health, defaulking the ſame out of their wages or other allowance of the Captaines: If any man ſhal happen to be ſlaine, or otherwiſe to depart out of this life, the Clerke of the Band ſhall adminiſter vpon his goods, and making a true Inuentory or prayſure thereof, (after his debts and defaulcations are paid) ſhall bee anſwerable for the reſt to his next of blood, or elſe ſuch on whome by Will he had formerly beſtowed it. He<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14641:34"/>ſhall alſo keepe a true note of the time of his death, whereby a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate may be made to the Muſter-maſter, and ſo that neither the Prince may be deceiued in his pay, nor yet the victualers ouer reckon the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in the multiplicitie of their victualls; He is to ſee that ſuch as are wounded be duely dreſſed by the Surgeons, and if that any bee taken Priſoner, hee is to awaken his Captaines memory touching their Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>To conclude if he be a good Clerke he is an excellent member both for Captaine and Souldier, for it is impoſſible that any Captaine ſhould thriue if he haue an euill and vnconſcionable Clerke, for the waies are ſo infinite by which hee may deceiue him, that not all the eies and tongues which are vpon <hi>Rumors</hi> outſide, can either deſerne or vnfold them till the miſcheife be ſo rotten that no medecine can cure it; and on the other ſide if he be all for the Captaine and haue no honeſt reſpect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Souldier, then vnleſſe the Captaine be a Saint, the miſchiefe is much more hainous, for all being fiſh that comes to his net, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure vp the Companie ten times worſe then the Enemie; and therefore a moſt eſpeciall care would be had to the ellection of this Officer, for hauing the diſtribution of all the Captaines waters, it is in his power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to kill or comfort at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>There is another Officer depending vpon a foote Companie, which in ſome ſmall parts reſembleth this, and is called in the warrs a
<hi>Furrier</hi> or <hi>Harbenger,</hi> one that in marching and watching hath no command at all; But when the Company is drawne into Gariſon, then he taketh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the effect of his authority, which is from the <hi>Serieant Maior</hi> (or other Officer his Deputie) to receiue all Billets due for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, and to diſtribute them to the Company ſo as euery man may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated according to the abillity of the place and neceſſitie of the times, he is alſo vpon the placing of a Campe to attend the
<hi>Quarter-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> generall, and hauing receiued his proportion of ground and diſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Streets, he is to quarter his owne Company and to allot to euery man the ground whereon to place his Cabbin. Euery iudicious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine may out of his Companie ſoone picke out a man fit for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for the art is eaſie and if at any time he ſhould doubt, he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold example enough round about him. Theſe, although they haue a certaine power, yet are but common Souldiers, neither can they well be Ranckt with the Officers of a Company, for in theſe is only but a kind of Truſt, in the Officers is both a Truſt and Commandment, as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe already hath ſhewed to your Lordſhip, which if it bee either briefer then you wiſh, or longer then your leaſure in the reading could aſsigne it: Remember my (Lord) that Souldiers howſoeuer they loue ſwiftneſſe in their Actions, yet they cannot indure to haue their <hi>Tales</hi> broken.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is (Noble Sir) your honour'd place and Birth which makes me fixe your name to this Epiſtle, and it muſt be your Vertue and loue to the Souldier, which muſt make mee appeare blameleſſe in your opinion: for I muſt confeſſe, I haue nothing to riſe vp betweene my ſelfe and your good thoughts, but onely this, That howſoeuer now we are ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and beholders of our neighbours troubles, yet we haue beene our ſelues vpon the Stage, and may be againe when God ſhall take his Protection from vs, and therefore this Art of Warre is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be contemned nor forgotten.</p>
               <p>To proceed then in my Range of Martiall dependants, the next which doth precede thoſe which I haue ouerpaſſed, are the <hi>Drumme</hi> and <hi>Phiph,</hi> which for as much as like the former they are Officers of power, and not of commaund, therefore I may in no wiſe giue them place before the Commanders, only I will allow them according to their place in March, and their greatneſſe in entertainment to be the beſt of priuate Souldiers; and as they are Inſtruments of direction and incouragement to others: ſo are they by ſuperiour Officers to be directed themſelues. Now albe I doe ioyne theſe two Officers together, and that in Ranke and pay they are all one, yet it is to be vnderſtood, that the <hi>Phiph</hi> is but onely an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of pleaſure, not of neceſſitie, and it is to the voice of the <hi>Drum</hi> the Souldier ſhould wholly attend, and not to the aire of the whiſtle; for the one (which is the <hi>Drumme</hi>) ſpeakes plainely and diſtinctly, the other<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14641:35"/>ſpeakes loud and ſhrill, but yet curiouſly and confuſedly, and therefore the <hi>Drumme</hi> being the very tongue and voyce of the Commander, he is to haue an exceeding carefull and diligent eare vnto all the wordes of directions (and are called our
<hi>Vocabula Artis</hi>) which ſhall proceed from the Captaine, and accordingly to performe and ſpeake it in his beatings; for to miſtake and do contrary, as to beat a Retrait when he is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Charge, or to beat a Charge when men are to retire, were a thing of that danger, that the armie might periſh by the action. Therefore as it is behouefull that euery
<hi>Drum</hi> take heed to his directions, ſo it is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that euery Souldier bee diligent to learne and vnderſtand all the vſefull beatings of the <hi>Drumme,</hi> and that the <hi>Drumme</hi> himſelfe be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and pliable to inſtruct and informe whoſoeuer of his company that is deſirous to be informed in the ſame; and to make plaine vnto them the alteration of notes, and how they differ in their ſignifications, and which way (with the moſt eaſe) they may apprehend the ſame. Of which Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the <hi>Drum,</hi> theſe are the moſt behouefull &amp; vſefull for euery raw Souldier to learne. Firſt, in the morning the diſcharge or breaking vp of the <hi>Watch,</hi> then a preparation or Summons to make them repaire to their Colours; then a beating away before they begin to march; after that a <hi>March</hi> according to the nature &amp; cuſtom of the country (for diuers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries haue diuers Marches) then a <hi>Charge,</hi> then a
<hi>Retrait,</hi> then a <hi>Troupe,</hi> and laſtly a <hi>Battalion,</hi> and a <hi>Battery,</hi> beſides other ſounds which depending on the phantaſttikenes of forrain nations are not ſo vſeful: for according to the opinion of Sir <hi>Roger Williams,</hi> Drums are but onely to direct, it is the man which muſt fight: Neither ought a man to be (like Captaine
<hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi>) ſo nice or curious in the beatings of the <hi>Drumme,</hi> proportioning the body, legges, head, hands and euery motion ſo exactly to euery ſtroke or doubling of the <hi>Drumme,</hi> as if it were almoſt a treaſon in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to walke without that Inſtruments aſſiſtance. Theſe ſuperſtitious cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities in matters of ſo weake importance, are diſparagements to wiſe mens reputations; and when they take vpon them to frame a Cuſtome of almoſt impoſſible actions, they ſo looſe themſelues in the fondneſſe of their deſignes; that many excellent vertues wherwith they ſtand poſſeſt, neither can nor will be diſcerned through theſe black clouds of phantaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique reſolution: For thus <hi>Hindar</hi> taking vpon him to write a Booke of this vnneceſſary ſubiect (though he had many rare knowledges in him) yet had them ſo caſt out of mens memories, that the more he labored to get beliefe, the more he loſt the credit of his eſtimation. And yet this I muſt ſay for him, that it is ſuppoſed by many well iudging Souldiers, that he was one of the firſt which gaue light to our late <hi>Poſtures,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable motions, and albe not in that perfection in which they now are, yet queſtionleſſe, hee found out the Grounds and Baſes whereon others did erect their goodlier buildings: Let therefore the <hi>Drumme</hi> ſtudie Art and plainneſſe, for that is the beſt to draw a dull mind to apprehenſion; and when his duties in the Field are finiſhed, if then being retired into the Tent, he haue then other artificiall and Muſical ſtraines, wherwith to<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14641:35"/>ſteale away the minds and eares of his hearers, it will be a great honour vnto him; neither for mine owne part haue I heard more ſweet or more ſolemne melodie, then that which the
<hi>Drumme</hi> and <hi>Flute</hi> hath afforded.</p>
               <p>It is the Office of the <hi>Drumme</hi> to make all Proclamations, and with an audible voyce to declare all the commaundements of the Generall or Captaine: they are to call and ſummon the Souldiers together to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all manner of duties, and when any dies, the <hi>Drumme</hi> with a ſad ſolemnitie muſt bring him to his graue, for it is the only mourner for the loſt, and the greateſt honor of Funerals: whence it comes that any man dying (aboue the degree of a common Souldier) the <hi>Drum</hi> performing the laſt dutie, may for his fee challenge the Sword of the deceaſed.</p>
               <p>It is the Office of the <hi>Drumme</hi> to ſummon all Townes before they be beſieged, and to carie the <hi>Generals</hi> Defiances or Braues to the enemy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as he ſhall be directed; he is the ordinary Meſſenger to carrie all meſſages to and fro betweene the
<hi>Generall</hi> &amp; the enemy, and between Commander and Commander, but eſpecially at ſuch time as faire Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is holden: At night when the watch is to be ſet, the <hi>Drumme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Maior</hi> beginneth firſt to beat it, and then after him all the reſt in their order through the whole Armie or Garriſon, and then after prayers are ſaid, they conduct their Squadron to their <hi>Corps du guard,</hi> &amp; ſo attend to giue ſeconds to euery Alarme. A <hi>Drumme</hi> (though martiall in euery part of his calling) is yet rather a man of Peace then of the ſword, and it is moſt diſhonourable in any man (wittingly and out of his knowledge) to ſtrike him or wound him: and yet queſtionleſſe many of them are exceeding valiant, and indeed no leſſe they ought to bee: for valour and courage is neceſſary in all their imployments, for his place is euer at his Captaines heeles, it is he that brings the Battels to ioyne, hee ſtands in the middeſt when Swords flie on all ſides; he brings them to pell, mell, and the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of execution; and it is he that brings them both on and off, when they are either fortunate, or abandoned and forſaken.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Drumme</hi> that will be accounted abſolute, and euery way fitting for his place, muſt beſides the exquiſiteneſſe and skilfulneſſe in his Art and Inſtrument, and the Rudiments of Martiall Diſcipline, bee alſo a good Linguiſt, and well ſeene in forraine Languages: for by the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of Meſſages, he muſt commerce and haue to doe with people of ſundry Nations, which (for want of knowledge being diſcharged by any ſecond perſon, it is a great diſparagement to the
<hi>Drumme,</hi> and his Ignorance makes him a ſeruant which otherwiſe might be a Maſter. It is alſo the Office and dutie of the <hi>Drumme</hi> to carry Ranſomes, and pay the agreements betweene his ſide and the enemie: It is hee that muſt trucke and compound for Priſoners; hee muſt bring them home when they are redeemed, and place them in ſafetie; and it is he that muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct Pledges, carry them and recarry them, and leade to the enemy and his owne Tents ſuch Hoſtages and Priſoners as ſhall be exchanged: he may vpon tolleration from the <hi>Generall,</hi> carrie Challenges and Defian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from one enemie to another, and either for Honour or Ladies<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14641:36"/>loues make compoſition for ſingle Encounters, prouided it bee vpon foot, as with the Puſh of the Pike, the Locking of Halberds, the Ioyning of Partizans, the Croſſing of Swords, or elſe the Exchanging of Bullets: but if it be vpon Horſeback, then it is the office of the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> and the <hi>Drumme</hi> hath no intereſt in it.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore mine Epiſtle (for I feare I haue beene te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to your Lordſhippe, and like a weary Traueller am loath to goe out of the beaten path wherein I take delight) it is moſt neceſſary that the
<hi>Drumme</hi> and <hi>Phiph</hi> bee men of verie able and praiſe-worthie qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and of comely and well ſhaped proportions, and indued with all theſe eſpeciall Vertues which ſhould adorne a perfect Souldier, as
<hi>Obedience, Silence, Secrecie, Sobrietie, Valour,</hi> and
<hi>Loyaltie,</hi> that ſo they may bee the great Examples of duetie to thoſe which ſhall liue about them: cloſe in all Counſels, Temperate in deliuering Meſſages, Stout in performing the will of their Commaunders, and faithfull in all their vndertakings: all which will bee as ſo many Crownes and Garlands to adorne their good deeds; and by that meanes Vertue will neuer forſake them, nor will true Reward and Merit loſe a Purchaſe it hath got with ſo much Honour.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Being curious (my noble Lord) not to let paſſe any thing that may challenge dependance vpon this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which I haue taken in hand (though of neuer ſo ſmall and vnreſpected conſequence) I thought meete to reſt in this Epiſtle vpon the Office of the
<hi>Lanſpeſado,</hi> which notwithſtanding, it bee the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and loweſt of all Offices of commandment and indeed but the very ſhaddow or appariſion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inferior place; yet in reſpect it is the firſt and of equall antiquitie with many: I will not ſticke to beſtow two houres Meditation vpon the ſame. And therefore to begin firſt of all with the name of this Officer, it is to be vnderſtood that <hi>Lanſpeſado</hi> (which is the firſt and meaneſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in an Armie that hath any Commandment) is the ſame whom the <hi>Romans</hi> cal'd <hi>Decario,</hi> others
<hi>Cabo-de-Camarado, Cabo-de-Camara</hi> or <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe-ſpezzate,</hi> any or all which ſignifie a Deputie Corporall, and was indeed in the auncient diſcipline a Commander of ten perſons, for when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies were firſt compounded, they were then deuided into Squadrons, and the Squadrons into Files, and the Files into fellowſhips or <hi>Camara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi> &amp; ouer theſe fellowſhips were made Leaders or Chiefes which they called
<hi>Lanſpeſados</hi> being (as it were) the principall man of eleauen, but in our moderne warrs it a little varieth, for now when companies are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into Squadrons, ouer ths Squadron is appointed a Corporall, and vnder the Corporall a <hi>Lanſpeſado,</hi> who as his Deputie and in his abſence (whether it be vpon a Guard, Watch or otherwiſe) is to performe all his duties and Office; but in the preſence of the Corporall, hee is only the leader of a File, and hath the charge or ouerlooking of halfe a Squadron, otherwiſe of this officer is little more required then of euery other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and common Souldier.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:14641:37"/>Theſe ought to be elected out of the moſt ſufficienteſt of all the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Ranke of perſons, and to be of a carefull, obedient, and actiue ſpirit, of a ſubtill &amp; wiſe diſpoſition, they ought to be the beſt experimented of that Ranke and to be voyd of turbulent qualities, louers of concord and enemies of muteny and ſedition; if they be old &amp; experienc'd Soudiers; euerry man almoſt is able with ſufficiencie to diſcharge this place, but if they bee ſluggiſh, Baſe and deboſht fellowes, there is no Practiſe, Experience, nor Inſtruction whatſoeuer which can make them capable of ruling of other. Againe if they bee new leuyed Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and haue neuer ſeene the warrs, then there will be ſome difficultie in the election, and a man can hardly diſcharge what he doth not know. But queſtionles, it is hard if in the number of fiue and twenty men, two may not be found which haue either ſeene or had ſome ſmall taſt of the warres; yet ſuppoſe they haue not, it then behoueth the Captaine to looke into their naturall Inclinations and their aptnes, willingnes &amp; loue vnto martiall exerciſe, and from thence to chuſe out ſuch as hee findes quickeſt of apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, fulleſt of care, vigilance, valor and obſeruation, who by the helpe and aſsiſtance of his other Officers (whoſe aduice in this election he ought to require) may be made worthy and fit to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them this commandment. But beware by all meanes of making choice of a <hi>Drunkard, Ruffian,</hi> or
<hi>Prophane perſon,</hi> for they are moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious in theſe places, yet if any ſmall falt happen, ſeeke by admonition to reclaime it, or elſe by threatning to diſplace him, for in the warres there is not any thing more diſgracefull, or grieuous to a Souldier, then to be pulld backe or caſt from authority, ſince all men ſtand at the ladder foote, and only indeauor to ariſe and get vp vpon the Scale of aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that I conclude if any of theſe Inferior Officers bee ſubiect to ſome crimes, yet the very ſhame of diſhonor and falling, will ſo afflict &amp; torment him, that it will inforce him to endeauor amendment; but if the wound be deſperate, it is no matter though hee periſh, and the chang is wholeſome; for we muſt ſuppoſe that at the firſt leuying or raiſing of men, their humors cannot bee knowne, neither is it fit to giue Rule (though neuer ſo meane) to an vnruly perſon. Thus much I thought to write touching his election, &amp; haue the longer Inſiſted thereon, becauſe being elected there is ſome difficultie &amp; trouble in the remoue. It now remaineth that I proceed to his aptnes or fitnes for the ſame; for which there are many ſtrong reaſons, as firſt that there is no encreaſe of pay or peculier charge to the State, neither is there any thing in it to wooe his continuance thereunto, more then a little hope of glory, for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is only Superiority of place and hope of aduancement, which is from that place to a Corporall, thence to a Serieant, and thence ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely according to his merit &amp; fortune, which hope makes him ſtrong in his diligence, and carefull in all his duties, ſtriuing in all things to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine his companions, and as he is in a place aboue them, ſo in the merit thereof to exceede them, and both in Marches, Skirmiſhes, and euery other occurrent of warre, to be vnto them an example and preſident.</p>

It is intended (conſidering the freenes of ſuch mens thoughts, &amp; how vnapt they are to conceale what they imagine) that nothing can be done or pretended to which he ſhall not be preuie (of what nature ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the miſcheife be) if he be diſcreete &amp; honeſt: he ſhall be watchfull and diligent to liſten after all alarmes, and when hee heareth any, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken and rouſe vp thoſe of his Deuiſion and to ſee that they iſſue not rudely or vnprouided, but with their armes about them in a decent and neceſſary faſhion; and to his vttermoſt power doe all thinges that may bring on or further the ſeruice. In their watch they are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty Corporals, and when the Corporall is abſent the <hi>Lanſpeſado</hi> ſhall take his place; command the Guard, appoint, ſet forth &amp; relieue
<hi>Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,</hi> he ſhall take the word, receiue Priſoners taken in the watch, deliuer them ouer vnto his Superior Officer, &amp; indeede doe all things whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer which belongs to the Corporall, and to this end, as in his owne place, ſo in the Corporalls alſo he ſhall be pregnant and ready, (the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof followeth in the next inſuing Epiſtle) laſtly it is his duty to inſtruct his Deuiſion in all the rudiments which belongs to their places as well in the manage of their Armes, as in the comely and well keeping of the ſame, and to that end hee ſhall ſhew them how to keepe their Armours &amp; weapons from Ruſt, &amp; with what Ingredience, how to take their Pieces aſſunder and to make them cleane, and when need is how to vnbreech them; he ſhall (if need be) caſt their Bullets for them, dry
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14641:38"/>their powder, and haue alwayes ſpare match in a readines, or at leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them how to doe it themſelues, for that ſhall be to him ſome eaſe and to them a greater profit.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing ſhewed the duty of this Officer I will now returne to his vſe, which though it conſiſt in many things and all without any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary charge, yet the greateſt vſe of all, is when Battalions are deuided or ſubdeuided into many petty fractions, then this Inferior Officer (who in a greater Body would be Ignorant) in this leſſer Body will bee as knowing as any Officer can be. And ſuperior Officers who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Battalions, Regiments, Companies and Squadrons, hauing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vnder their commands, cannot attend to reuiſite and looke into Files and halfe Squadrons, or ſee (being farre remoued) whether they ſtand in their true and perfit diſtance, in this caſe this Officer is as helpefull as any (to them which command in cheife) and obſerues all proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, qualities and motions both of ſuch as follow or ſuch as front with him; for indeed, the motions in Files I can compare to nothing more fitly then to the dauncing of the old meaſures, in which if there be a good Leader, that by his eare can truely diſtinguiſh the ſound of the Inſtrument, and knowes when to double or ſingle, forward, backward, ſideway and on either hand, or when to begin and when to end, that then it much skills not what the followers counnings be. So in Files if there be a perfit Leader &amp; but tractable obſeruers, hardly can any Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce do hurt in the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but here me thinks an old Souldier that loues not booke knowledge, pulls me by the eare, and ſaies: what? haue all warrs theſe diſtinctions? or haue theſe places beene from the beginning? beleeue it, I haue beene in ſeruices where if you ſhould ſpeake of
<hi>Decario</hi> or <hi>Lanſpeſado,</hi> they would take it for ſome heathen Greeke, or a more dangerous language: to which I anſwer, that indeed they are not vſed in all warrs, much leſſe in euery company, but I dare with conſtancie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that the beſt vnderſtanders in Martiall Diſcipline, doe with all ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity both vſe them and apply themſelues vnto them, finding them ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and behouefull, that where there is a neglect or diſdaine thereof, there without all queſtion the company hath a wound, and the whole Armie wants (if not more) yet one feature of an excellent beautie.</p>
               <p>Some latter writers haue giuen this name a farre different interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, calling them voluntary Lieutenants or Knights of <hi>Saint Georges</hi> Squadron, and applying them to the duties of a Gentleman of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie or a Rounder; but it is only a fancie, and I haue already ſhewed what they are and what depends vpon them: therefore in mine Epiſtle I will auoid diſputation and only conclude, that what I haue writ, mine experience hath ſeene, and what I affirme, all readings will allow to haue the beſt authoritie.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et it not (my Lord) be offenſiue, if for an houre or leſſe I begge you from your more ſerious thoughts, to vouchſafe the reading of this blunt Epiſtle: for beleeue it (noble Sir) there muſt bee an Affection to your Goodneſſe to moue me, and ſome hope in the labour that this ſeruice will Inne the time you ſpend in the traffique, or elſe queſtionleſſe I ſhould wiſh my ſelfe halfe loſt, and the papers conſumed: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, it is Warre (which is the Garland of Nobilitie) and though time be neuer ſo pretious, yet none can be ſaid to be loſt that is beſtowed on ſo worthy a Subiect.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Corporall</hi> (to whom now my diſcourſe leads me) is he whom the Spaniard cals <hi>Cabo de Eſquadra,</hi> and being a degree aboue the <hi>Lanſpeſado,</hi> is the Commander of a whole Squadron, which Squadron is commonly the fourth part of a Company that is compounded of one hundred; and it is diuided into two <hi>Camarados</hi> or fellowſhips, each containing twelue perſons, that is to ſay, ten <hi>Sentinels,</hi> one Gentleman, and a <hi>Lanſpeſado,</hi> ſo that the whole Squadron is twentie foure men beſides the <hi>Corporall,</hi> which makes vp a full ſquare of fiue (which is the leaſt Battalion.) Now though I here ſet downe this certaine number, to expreſſe an vncertaine quantitie, yet know it is in the Captaines power to make his Squadrons bigger or leſſe at his own pleaſure; yet this proportion is moſt fit (though not alwayes conſtant) and therfore moſt neceſſary, yea the old Souldiers doe, and the good Souldiers will finde it moſt beſt.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Corporall</hi> ought to be a man carefully choſen out, and indued with Valor, Vertue, Diligence and Experience; he ought to be of reuerend and graue yeares, thereby to draw on reſpect, but withall of a ſound Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for experience without it, is but like a Iewell in the bottom of the<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14641:39"/>ſea, which neither adornes it ſelfe nor others; hee muſt be a cheriſher of vertue, and a louer of concord, for he is ſaid to be the father of his ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, and muſt therefore loue them and prouide for them as for his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall children.</p>
               <p>Touching the quality of his place, he is firſt to ouerſee the <hi>Lanſpeſado,</hi> that he doe his dutie in all occaſions, &amp; that the Armes of his Squadron be kept neat and cleane, as hath been formerly ſhewed, that euery man haue ſuch munition as belongs to his place, that hee keepe it ſafe, and make no waſte thereof, but vpon needfull occaſions: he ſhall ſtirre them vp to goe neat in their apparell, and reproue them for any thing that is contrary to the articles of the Army: he ſhall ſee them ready to perform any dutie when they are commanded; and he ſhall call them often to the exerciſe of their Armes, and according to his skill, bee ready to inſtruct them: he ſhall at the ſetting of the watch bring forth his Squadron in a decent and comely manner, and hauing (from the <hi>Serieant</hi> or other ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Officer) receiued the <hi>Word</hi> (in a ſecret and reuerend ſort) hee ſhall then draw them to the <hi>Corps du guard,</hi> where it is his place to prouide coale, wood, or other fuell to keepe a continuall fire, both for the ſauing of Match, lighting of Creſſets, or for other commodities: then hee ſhall draw forth his <hi>Sentinels,</hi> and place them (according to the neceſſity of the times) either <hi>Single</hi> or <hi>double, Perdues</hi> or otherwiſe, and he ſhal giue them their charge and directions, and place them in their <hi>Sentinell</hi> poſture; then vpon his returne he ſhall call foorth the Gentlemen <hi>Rounders,</hi> and ſend them abroad to make a ſearch of the watch, and to ſee that euery
<hi>Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell</hi> doe his dutie, which to performe he ſhall giue them the
<hi>Word</hi> in their eares ſeuerally: then he ſhall place himſelfe vpon the <hi>Corps du guard,</hi> and both ſit ſilently himſelfe, and cauſe others to doe the ſame, that hee may the better apprehend any call whatſoeuer: Aſſoone as the <hi>Sentinell</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, he ſhall anſwer <hi>Holla,</hi> and immediatly go either himſelfe ſingle, with his ſword drawn, or (in eſpeciall caſes where the enemy lodgeth neere) with a guard of two at leaſt (being a Pike and a Shot) vnto the <hi>Sentinell,</hi> and making his Guard ſtand vpon their guard, he ſhall place the point of his Sword to the left breſt of him that is to giue the <hi>Word</hi> (whether he be <hi>Rounder</hi> or other priuat meſſenger, &amp; ſo fixing his point to his breſt with his left thumbe (laying his eare to his mouth very cloſly) receiue the <hi>Word,</hi> which if it be right, he ſhall giue the party paſſage, if otherwiſe, he ſhall take him priſoner, and diſarme him, then lead him to his guard, and there keepe him till it be morning, or elſe deliuer him to his ſuperiour of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer: but if any reſiſtance be offered, then it ſhalbe lawfull for the <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> to kill him: thus he ſhall continue his watch till it be day, or that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther companies come to relieue him; and he ſhall according to the ſeaſon of the weather, the danger of the place, &amp; the ſtrength of his Squadron, change and relieue the <hi>Sentinels</hi> ſo oft as he pleaſeth, and alwayes proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that in the firſt Round, if the Captaine of the watch come himſelfe, or the Generall vndiſguiſed, that then the <hi>Corporall</hi> ſhal take notice ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and not receiue the <hi>Word</hi> but giue it: and that all theſe things may<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14641:39"/>with more readineſſe be performed, it is meet that the <hi>Corporall</hi> haue in perfit memory both the names and ſurnames of all in his Squadron; alſo if it be vpon a new encampment, or vpon the firſt ſitting down of a ſiege, he ſhall then take his directions for placing the <hi>Sentinell,</hi> either from the
<hi>Scout-maſter,</hi> or ſome other of his owne ſuperiour officers; and where the dangers are eminent, or (in common opinion) deſperat, there the
<hi>Corporal</hi> ſhall place for <hi>Sentinels,</hi> the oldeſt Souldiers he hath, men of greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, or Gentlemen of ſpeciall ranke and vertue: and laſtly, he ſhall haue an eſpeciall care not to giue the word to any new or raw Souldiers, but to ſuch as are of knowledge and experience, for any ſmall miſtake or omiſſion might breed a diſturbance ouer all the Armie.</p>
               <p>It is alſo the Office of the <hi>Corporall,</hi> when the Company liueth vpon Prouant victuals, to receiue from the <hi>Clerke, Serieant</hi> or other Offficer, all the prouant-victuals which do appertaine to his Squadron, and to ſee the ſame weighed and truly ſhared amongſt them with all indifferencie and equality, without any reſpect of perſons, or hope of lucre and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſhall ſee, that in their Cabins and lodgings they do ſo accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date themſelues, that they may liue together like louers &amp; companions, neither peſtring themſelues ſo together that they may breed infection or ſicknes, nor yet like melancholy
<hi>Hares,</hi> liue ſo alone and retired, that men may imagine their muſings to be nothing els but dreames and plots of future miſchiefe: and truly it is held for a maxime (amongſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Souldiers) that a buſie mind in an idle or retired body, is like an vnruly and tempeſtuous wind, which being long reſtrain'd, and breaking out with all his ſtrength and malice about it, ouerturnes and teares vp by the roots whatſoeuer withſtands it, Nay euen in Princes themſelues it is mightily diſallowed, and they are ſaid, when they doe affect too much ſolitarineſſe, to be like cag'd vp Lions, which neuer walke abroad, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to affright or hurt; and hence it comes, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> neuer ſuſpected <hi>Brutus</hi> alacritie, but euer feared <hi>Caſſius</hi> melancholy, and therefore let the <hi>Corporall</hi> be carefull to keepe his Squadron from theſe extremities.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Corporals</hi> Squadron goes forth to ſerue vpon the face of the enemy, he ſhall himſelfe leade the principall Fyle, and by his example both make them come on with all brauery, and by his obſeruations make them moſt diligently obſerue all the commands of their Superiours: he muſt not allow any to ſet his foot before him, or to outſtrip him in cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage (prouided he exceed not the bounds of diſcretion) neither muſt any expreſſe the knowledge of command more then himſelfe; for he muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually vnderſtand both how to obey, &amp; how to command, &amp; therwithal it muſt be mixt with ſuch a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perance, that he muſt neither ouerdoe nor vnderdoe, leſt he vtterly vndoe; for the one ſhewes Raſhnes, and the other Baſeneſſe, both which are faults of that extremitie, as they neuer haue power to iſſue forth, but ſtill puniſhment ouertakes them. It is likewiſe a part of his dutie (if he be a Shot) to obſerue that none of his Squadron diſcharge too ſoone or amazedly without aduiſe, for then they ſeldome hit, and men are naturally ſo prone to come to an end of their feare and<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14641:40"/>trouble, that the fault of leiſure is ſeldome perceiued: beſides, when they diſcharge before the enemy be come within the diſtance of point-blank, they not onely loſe their labour, but giue the enemy leaue to approch without danger, and ſo are either put to rout, or elſe performe ſome grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inconuenience: for this manner of too early diſcharging diſcouers an vnnaturall feare, and where that is, neither can Aduiſe nor true Leuell be taken, but as it is the child of Confuſion, ſo confuſed are all things which either mixe or come neere it. To conclude, when men diſcharge their ſhot with leiſure and diſcretion, and that the volley goes wholly and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely together, when leuell is truly taken, and the Obiect not ſuppoſed, but conſtantly perceiued, then doth ten Shot more good then an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and the example and wounds which proceed from ſo ſtrong a Reſolution, more ſhakes the hearts of the enemy, then all the fires, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frights or noiſes that Gunns, Arts, or mens voices can vtter; and that this may be performed with better perfection, the <hi>Corporall</hi> ſhall teach his Squadron how to giue their peeces their full lading, and how to ramme in their Bullets to the beſt aduantage of the blow: ſo that all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in a decent and artificiall forme together, the Diſcipline may be ſo abſolute, that no newe Curioſitie or Inuention can ſtart vp to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it.</p>
               <p>Infinite much might a knowing Experience write of this mans Place and Office, and of the variation of opinions touching the ſame, but my deſire is to draw as neere as I can to our beſt moderne Practiſe, and to that diſcipline which is moſt frequent in our Nation, that whoſoeuer ſhall come to apparell his mind in theſe Inſtructions, may not walk forth py-bald and Antiquely ſuited, but in ſuch an habit as all his Countrey-men may know him, allow him, and indeed imitate him; all other I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count but gaudie <hi>Boskage,</hi> or idle <hi>Croteſco</hi> worke, on which whenſoeuer a man fixes his eye, though he finde Art and Proportion in the knots, trayles and deuices, yet if hee gaze on the Faces and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, he ſhall find them gaſtly, vgly, halfe mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and out of all comely proportion.</p>

Beſides theſe he ſhall alſo teach them how to giue their vollies with thoſe in their Ranke, as when the firſt Ranke haue giuen their vollie (if the Battalia march) then that firſt Ranke to ſtand ſtill and the ſecond to paſſe through it and ſo giue their vollie and then to ſtand, and the third to aduance vp and ſo conſequently all the Rankes, but if the <hi>Battalia</hi> ſtand, the firſt Ranke hauing giuen their vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſhall fall backe to the Reare either in wheele or in countermarch, and<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14641:42"/>the ſecond Ranke ſhall come into their places and giue their vollie and ſo conſequently all the reſt; but if the <hi>Battalia</hi> fall backe or Retire, then ſhall all the ſhot ſtand ſtill and no man aduance a foote of ground, but the firſt Ranke ſhall giue their vollie and then fall backe to the Reare, ſo likewiſe the ſecond Ranke, and fall backe in like manner, and ſo all the reſt till they haue loſt ſo much ground as to the Commander ſhall ſeeme ſufficient, ſo ſhall the vollie ſtill be continued and the enemie neuer free from anoyance.</p>
               <p>To conclude, a good Serieant is an admirable benefit, and if he liue and execute his place well any long time, no man deſerueth aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before him, for beſides all that hath beene ſpoken of him, hee is of wonderfull vſe in all <hi>Scalados, Aſſaults, Mines,</hi> or things of that Nature; and if to beautifie all the precedent vertues, he likewiſe be inriched with any ſmall proportion of learning, eſpetially in the Art of Arithmaticke, whereby he may iudge of the alteration and proportion of ſundry bodies and how to deuide and ſubdeuide numbers at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, then I dare affirme he is an abſolute Serieant, nor can his Captaine wiſh or deſire a rarer or better Iewell to depend vpon his perſon.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Enſigne</hi> or <hi>Alferes</hi> (as the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> cals him) is (my good Lord) the firſt great Officer of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Company: for all the former (howſoeuer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary) are but petty and low places, this only the firſt of Eminence and Account; and therefore in his election great conſideration is to bee had, and to the making vp of his perfection many great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are required, as <hi>Valour, Wiſedome, Fidelitie,</hi> and <hi>Honeſtie:</hi> he hath the guard of his Captaines Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and therein is truſted with his Honour and Reputation, and if hee be comely of perſon, ſtrong and amiable, hee is a greater glorie to his place, and more becomming in Seruice: but becauſe in the Warres, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers expect to be aduanc't by Succeſſion, as a Lieutenant to riſe to bee a Captaine; an Enſigne, a Lieutenant; the eldeſt Serieant, an Enſigne; the Corporall, a Serieant; and the Lanſpeſado, a Corporall: I will leaue to argue more of his choice, and onely affirme, it is enough if he be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for that makes him worthy.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Enſigne</hi> wee corruptly call <hi>Antient,</hi> and I haue ſeene it written <hi>Antefigne,</hi> but for mine owne part I rather take it to come of <hi>Inſignia,</hi> becauſe in the firſt times men carried therein their Armes or Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. God himſelfe did firſt appoynt
<hi>Enſignes</hi> for the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael in their ſeuerall Tribes, &amp; by that Imitation it ſucceeded to the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Romans,</hi> and all ſorts of warlike Nations. They were in the firſt ages or wondrous great conſequence: for thoſe which wanne them did beare them and carry them as their owne, neither might the loſer euer beare<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14641:43"/>any after, except he wanne them in the field: but when the inconuenience of this was found, and it proued grieuous that one Chriſtian ſhould thus diſhonour another, then men began to forbeare the carrying of Armes, and only fixed therein a Deuiſe or Empreſa, and ſome but the only vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of two ſeuerall colours (and ſo are called Colours) as we doe now at this preſent; therfore to proceed to the accoutrements of our <hi>Enſigne;</hi> He ſhall be armed at all peeces from the mid-thigh vpward with a faire Sword by his ſide, and his Captaines Colours or <hi>Enſigne</hi> in his hand, which Colours if they belong to a priuate Captaine ought to bee mixt equally of two ſeuerall colours, that is to ſay (according to the rules of Herauldry) of Colour and Mettall, and not colour on colour, as Greene and Red, or Blacke and Blew, or ſuch like, nor yet mettall on mettall as White and Yellow, or Orangetawny and White: for colours ſo borne, ſhew Baſtardy, peaſantry, or diſhonor. Now in the corner which is next to the vpper part of the Staffe, hee ſhall carry in a faire large ſquare or Canton (containing a ſixth part of the Colours) a plaine Red croſſe in a white field (called Saint
<hi>Georges</hi> croſſe) which is the Enſigne of our king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of
<hi>England.</hi> If the colours doe belong to a Colonell, they ſhall then be all of one entire colour, or one entire mettall, only the Red croſſe or Enſigne of the kingdome ſhall be in his due place as aforeſaid. If they belong to a <hi>Colonell</hi> generall, to the Lord <hi>Marſhall</hi> of the field, or any ſuch ſuperiour Officer, then they ſhall be all of one entire colour or met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and the Red croſſe or Enſigne of the kingdom ſhall be in a very little ſquare or canton, as in an eight part of the field, or leſſe if it pleaſe them; But if they belong to the
<hi>Generall</hi> of the field, then they ſhall be of one entire colour or mettall without any Red croſſe at all. Now for as much as I haue ſeene here at home, and alſo in forraine nations (in the carriage of colours) as groſſe abſurdities as any malice could wiſh to behold in the folly of his enemy, and that doubtleſſe it proceeds from ignorance (ſince no maſter of Reaſon would be guiltie of his owne Iniury) I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here a little make bold to amplifie the ſame.</p>
               <p>It is then to be vnderſtood, that euery Gentleman of Coat-armor (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable to beare Colors, ought to carry them compounded of thoſe two principall colours which are contained in his Coat-armour, being the field and the chiefe charge thereof, which that no Ignorance may be buſie to finde out, they are euermore contained in the Band-role vpon which his Creſt ſtandeth, being indeed a true tipe or figure of his colours wreathed together as the ſupport of his honour.</p>
               <p>Now in as much as Captaines are not all Gentlemen of Coat-armor, and ſo take vnto themſelues (in theſe dayes) a more particular freedome, and ſay, that <hi>Honor</hi> is not buckled to them, but to their vertues, and that vertue conſiſts not in the fames of Anceſtors, but in their owne actions, and defences of the Church, their Countrie, King, and the oppreſſed, and ſo may ſuit or elect their colours according to their hopes and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, taking (as it were) <hi>Honor</hi> from any obiect they fancy: I will here therefore firſt ſhew you the nature and ſignification of colours, and then<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14641:43"/>ſome particular offences: in which an indifferent mixture being made, the compoſition muſt needs be Noble and wholeſome.</p>
               <p>There be in military <hi>Honor</hi> nine ſeuerall complexions, and are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by two names, the one Mettall, &amp; the other Colour. Of Mettals there be two, as <hi>Yellow</hi> and <hi>White</hi> (figuring Gold &amp; Siluer) and of colours there be ſeauen, as <hi>Blacke, Blew, Red, Greene, Purple, Tawnie</hi> and <hi>Ermine,</hi> the dignitie of all which being compared to <hi>Vertues, Heauenly bodies,</hi> and <hi>Precious ſtones,</hi> is a labour too great to diſcourſe in ſo ſhort an Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>For the ſignification of theſe colours, <hi>Yellow</hi> betokeneth <hi>Honour,</hi> or height of Spirit, which being neuer ſeparate from vertue in all things is moſt iealous of diſgrace, and may not indure the leaſt ſhadow of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>White</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Innocence,</hi> or puritie of Conſcience, Truth, and an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Integritie without blemiſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blacke</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Wiſedome</hi> and
<hi>Sobrietie,</hi> together with a ſeuere corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of too much Ambition being mixt with <hi>Yellow,</hi> or too much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe and leuitie being ioyned with <hi>White.</hi>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Red</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> or noble and worthy Anger in defence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or the oppreſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Greene</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Good Hope,</hi> or the accompliſhment of holy or honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Purple</hi> or <hi>Purpure</hi> ſignifieth
<hi>Fortitude</hi> with diſcretion, or a moſt true diſcharge of any truſt repoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tawnie</hi> or <hi>Tunnis,</hi> ſignifieth Merit or deſert, &amp; is a foe to Ingratitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ermine</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Religion</hi> or Holineſſe, and that all aymes are at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Obiects.</p>
               <p>Now from theſe Colours and their mixtures, are deriued many Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard and diſhonourable colours, as <hi>Carnation, Orangetawnie, Popeniay,</hi> and the like, all which haue Baſtardly ſignifications, as Craft, Pride, Wantonneſſe, and ſuch like, of which who ſo is deſirous to vnderſtand, let him looke into the French Authors, and he ſhall gaine ſatisfaction; for mine owne part, ſince they appertaine not vnto Honor, I will heere omit them, and to thoſe free Spirits which haue gained (deſeruedly) theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble places from theſe conſiderations, leaue them to their owne elections, with theſe few aduertiſements following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, hee that in his Colours ſhall carry Coat-armour, doth indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, for he puts that honour to hazard, which he may with more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour keepe in ſafetie, and inticeth his enemy by ſuch oſtentation to dare beyond his owne nature.</p>
               <p>He that in his Colours beareth any one blacke ſpot and no more, if it be round, ſquare, or of any equall proportion, it ſhewes ſome blemiſh in the owner, and that his life is not void of ſome notorious Scandall. But if the ſpot be of vnequall proportion, that is longer or broader one way then another, it ſignifieth Funerall or deadly reuenge, for ſuch a ſpot is called an <hi>Heirſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:14641:44"/>He that carieth a <hi>Word</hi> or
<hi>Motto</hi> in his Colours without a <hi>Deuiſe,</hi> cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Soule without a Body: he that carieth a <hi>Deuiſe</hi> without a <hi>Word,</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth a Body without a Soule: he that carieth both <hi>Word</hi> and
<hi>Deuiſe,</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth Soule and Body; yet if the <hi>Deuiſe</hi> carry any humane ſhape, it is a groſſe body: and if the <hi>Word</hi> containe aboue three or foure words at the moſt (except it be the latter end or beginning of ſome Latine verſe) it is an imperfit Soule: but if both
<hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Deuiſe</hi> be compleat, and that it is
<hi>Empreſa</hi> and not <hi>Embleme,</hi> yet they are much fitter for Maskes, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, &amp; Pageants then the field or honorable action; for the true mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Colours is deuiſe enough for euery Souldier. Laſtly, he that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carieth more colours then two, (except it be ſome ſmall daſh for an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall note, or the <hi>Enſigne</hi> of ſeuerall kingdomes) carrieth a ſurcharge, and it is eſteemed the <hi>Enſigne</hi> of Folly.</p>
               <p>To conclude then with the Office of this
<hi>Enſigne-bearer,</hi> he is to take charge of his Captaines Colours, to keepe them ſafely, to attend them duely at all commandements of his Superiors, and to defend them with the vttermoſt of his life in all dangers whatſoeuer; he ſhall carry them in ſuch place as his Superiors appoint, and according to his Captaines ranke and antiquitie: he ſhall neuer lodge nor diſlodge them but with a Guard, nor at any time ſhall leaue them abandon'd or forſaken: he may in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon challenge the firſt and principall lodging, &amp; that the Souldiers may know it (to repaire thither) he ſhall hang the Colours out in ſome conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place for a notice: hee is to chuſe vnto him foure or fiue eſpeciall Gentlemen, who as his mates and companions in all ſeruices, ſhall march about him to guard them: if he enter any Towne wall or Breach, he ſhal plant his Colours on the ſame: the more tatter'd and ragged they are, the more noble they are; and when any of his Company die, he ſhall at the buriall traile his Colours after the body to doe honour to the Funerall, but when the body is in the ground, hee ſhall then toſſe them vp and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play them. In the abſence of the Captaine and Lieutenant, he commands as abſolute Captaine, but in their preſence is bound to obey them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hee is of greater account then the lieutenant; but with vs it is not ſo, only he is a Gentleman of high worth; and if the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his vertue anſwere the worthineſſe of his place, there is nothing but Time and the hand of God that can bee able to ſtay him from being raiſed to a Captaine.</p>

<hi>Martiall</hi> Courts and ſpeake their oppinions, but haue no voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<hi>Liuetenants</hi> are Captaines of the Watch when it comes to their courſe, and ſhall that night haue a double Squadron of his owne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for as two Squadrons make a <hi>Serieancie,</hi> ſo two <hi>Serieancies</hi> make a <hi>Liuetenancie:</hi> and indeed the beſt compoſition of a Captaines Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie is two hundred Souldiers, a Captaine, a

               <p>Next, to the orderly Gouernment of the Company, and prouiding of all thinges neceſſary for their beſt accomodation; it is the Office of the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> to <hi>Traine</hi> and <hi>Drill</hi> his men, according to the art and skill of a good Souldier. In which action, that forme of Trayning is only to be followed which ſhall be ſooneſt and eaſieſt learned, that agrees with the preſent diſcipline of the times, and is of moſt vſe for all kinde of ſeruice: As firſt, to draw his company Fyle after Fyle into a ſquare Battalion, conſiſting of Rankes and Fyles, placing the Pikes in the midſt, and the Shot equally diuided on either ſide. Hee ſhall then let them vnderſtand that a Ranke, is a row of men placed pouldron to pouldron, their faces being directed all one way, and a Fyle is a ſequence of men ſtanding one behind another, backe to belly, and extending from the firſt to the laſt man, it is taken from the French word
<hi>La file,</hi> which ſignifies a thred, becauſe men ſtand longwiſe and ſtraight like a thred, and theſe conſiſt of ſingle men downward, as Rankes conſiſt of ſingle men ouerthwart. A Ranke may conſiſt of as many men as you pleaſe, but a File (how euer the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and
<hi>Italians</hi> vſe it vncertaine) ought neuer to bee aboue ten perſons deepe (except it be in marching, or eſpeciall ſeruice where ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of the ground requireth the contrary) for the firſt man hauing diſcharged his Peece may in the ſpace that nine other men ſhal diſcharge their Peeces one after another, be againe in readynes and make his firſt place good, there to diſcharge his Peece againe; beſides, it is the readieſt and beſt way for the drawing of Groſes and great numbers into any forme whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Next hee ſhall teach them the carriage and vſe of their armes, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14641:45"/>the Pike, (for the Muſquet is in the Office of the Serieant) the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age wherof he ſhall deuide into theſe Poſtures; firſt three ſtanding, that is, <hi>Lay downe your Pike: Take vp your pike: Order your pike:</hi> Then ſixe marching, as, <hi>Aduance your pike: Shoulder your pike: Leuell your pike: Slope your Pike: Checke your pike:</hi> and <hi>Traile your pike:</hi> and laſtly, ſeauen charging, as,
<hi>Port ouer hand: Port vnder hand: Charge ouer hand: Charge vnder hand: Coutch ouer hand: Couch vnder hand: Charge againſt the right foote and draw your Sword ouer arme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When theſe are perfect he ſhall teach them diſtance of place in Files and Rankes, as when he would haue the Files to march
<hi>Cloſeſt,</hi> then the diſtance is pouldron to pouldron, or ſhoulder to ſhoulder; if but <hi>Cloſe,</hi> then the diſtance is a foote and a halfe man from man: If at their <hi>Order,</hi> then the diſtance is three foote betweene man and man: and if at <hi>Open-Order</hi> then the diſtance ſixe foote betweene man and man: ſo likewiſe in Rankes
<hi>Cloſeſt</hi> is at the Swords point: <hi>Cloſe</hi> is at three foote, <hi>Order</hi> at ſixe foote and <hi>Open-Order</hi> at twelue foote. Now there be ſome that vary in the tearmes but not in the diſtance, for they wil haue <hi>Cloſe, Order, Open-Order</hi> and <hi>Double Diſtance</hi> and not the word <hi>Cloſeſt,</hi> at all; but the ſcruple is ſmall and may be left to euery Commanders diſcretion.</p>
               <p>After this he ſhall teach them March and Motions: In the firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is little art more then in obſeruing truly their Rankes and Files, and diſtance in places: For <hi>Motions</hi> they vary diuerſly and ſome are no Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as when The Souldier turnes but his face on one hand or other or about: Some <hi>Motions</hi> change place, yet no more then a remoouing from one ranke to another, or from one File to another, in which, though ſome remoue yet others ſtand ſtil, as in doubling of Rankes or doubling of Files: and in this Motion is to be obſerued that Rankes when they double to the right hand, muſt euer turne on the left to come to their place againe: and if they be doubled to the left hand they muſt turne on the right hand to come to their pltces againe; ſo likewiſe Files when they are doubled to any hand, by the doubling of Rankes to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hand they are brought to their firſt place againe, and ſo of Rankes in the ſame nature.</p>
               <p>To conclude, there is another Motion to be taught in which all doe moue and yet none doe March, and that is the opening or cloſing either of Ranks or Files &amp; is of great vſe when one Ranke ſhould paſſe through another, or the whole body of the Battalion make a Countermarch, or when the Battell ſhould bee drawne ſpeedily more of one hand or another.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> ſhall teach his Souldier how to know all the ſounds or beatings of the Drumme, in which he ſhall make him obſerue not only what the Drumme doth beate, but alſo what time and meaſure hee keepeth, and according to that time and meaſure ſo to march ſlower or faſter, to charge with greater violence, or to come of with more ſpeede, alſo he ſhall teach them to know when by the Drumme to attend the Captaines directions, when to repaire to their Colours and<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14641:46"/>when to doe other duties, and as thus by the Drumme in ſeruice, ſo by his voyce and the words of directions, in Trayning he ſhall make them doe whatſoeuer hee pleaſeth, and therefore the Liuetenant ſhall haue perfecttly in his memory all the words of directions which are accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſpoken: As, <hi>Cloſe your Files, To the right hand: To the left hand:</hi> and all theſe ſhall be done either Cloſeſt, Cloſe, to Order or open Order: Then <hi>Open your Files, to the right hand: To the left hand,</hi> and theſe to any order. And thus to open or cloſe Rankes and to any Order, with this obſeruation, that Rankes when they open ought to turne to the Reare and open downeward, and when they cloſe to cloſe vpward; then <hi>Files and Rrankes cloſe: Files and Rankes open</hi> and theſe to any order alſo:
<hi>then Double your Files: To the right hand: To the left: Aduance your Files, to the right hand: to the left: Aduance by deuiſion, to right hand or left: Files ranke by conuerſion, to the right hand, to the left: Files ranke,</hi>
3. 5. 7. <hi>&amp;c. Shorten your Files to</hi> 5. 8. <hi>&amp;c. Lengthen your Files to</hi> 10. 12. 16. <hi>&amp;c. Files coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarch, to the right hand: to the left: Double your Rankes, to the right hand, to the left: Rankes file by conuerſion: to the right hand, to the left: Rankes ranke</hi> 5. 7.
<hi>&amp;c. Middle men double your front: to the right hand, to the left: Double to both by deuiſion: Rankes countermarch &amp;c. as in Files. Then faces to the right hand, to the left: to both by deuiſion: Faces about: Wheele by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion to the right hand, to the left: to both by deuiſion. Charge to the right hand, to the left: to both by deuiſion. Charge to the Front: Charge to the Reare. Charge to both by deuiſion:</hi> then to reduce any of theſe words to the ſame Order or Station in which the Souldier ſtood before they were ſpoken, the word is, <hi>As you were:</hi> And herein is to be obſerued that in Charging with Pikes halfe the Rankes are but to Charge and the other halfe to carry them aduanced or ported, ſo neare the heads of the formoſt as they may doe them no anoyance, either in Charging or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring, and they muſt alſo obſerue when they doe Charge ſtanding to fall backe with the right foote, and marching to ſtep forward with the left.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue ſhewed in a briefe Epiſtle the large extent of the <hi>Liuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi> Office, in which if I be either obſcure by reaſon of the compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes thereof, or a little confuſed in ſnatching here and there at his duties without ſetling conſtantly vpon any one; I hope your Lordſhip will call to minde it is an Epiſtle, the lawes whereof alowes me the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of familiar ſpeech, not of ſubtill argument, and for mine owne part I had rather leaue many nice wits vnſatiſfied, then your minde cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or tyred,</p>

               <p>I haue (my Lord) in the former <hi>Decads,</hi> briefly runne ouer all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour or lower Officers of the <hi>Infanterie,</hi> in which I haue touched their Elections, Vertues, Vſes, Duties, it remaineth now that I likewiſe aſcend as many ſteps in the <hi>Cauallarie,</hi> or

               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:14641:47"/>All Horſe-Troups commonly doe conſiſt of common <hi>Souldiers, Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> a <hi>Quarter-Maſter,</hi> a
<hi>Trumpet,</hi> a <hi>Clerke,</hi> a <hi>Cornet,</hi> and a
<hi>Lieutenant.</hi> Theſe Troups are alſo of ſundry ſorts, as Men at Armes, or <hi>Launciers,</hi> the armed French <hi>Piſtoleirs,</hi> the
<hi>Carbines,</hi> and the <hi>Light-horſe.</hi> The firſt of theſe are armed at all pieces from the head to the knee, with a cloſe Caske and Curaces of Piſtoll-proofe, a Lance in his right hand, a Sword by his left ſide, and a caſe of Piſtols at the forepart of his Saddle: the Horſe is capariſon'd with ſtrong Leather, a <hi>Headſtall, Noſeband,</hi> and
<hi>Raynes,</hi> with a faire <hi>Bit</hi> in his mouth, a <hi>Saddle</hi> plated before and behind with Steele, <hi>Brest-plate</hi> or <hi>Petterell, Crooper, Trappings,</hi> and <hi>Saker.</hi> The Horſe himſelfe ſhould be of the proudeſt and beſt generation, of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Size, his pace trotting, for the moſt part ſtoned (though luſtie, ſtrong and large Gueldings may be tollerable) and exceeding well ridden and manadg'd for the Warres, being quicke and nimble to ſtart into a ſwift cariere, eaſie to ſtop, and ready to turne on both hands without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order or knauiſh qualitie: the vſe of theſe are to charge vpon Pikes, to breake their
<hi>Battalions,</hi> and to put them into rout and diſorder.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort, which are armed <hi>Pistolleirs,</hi> are in all points to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutred like the former <hi>Launciers,</hi> without any difference, onely inſtead of the Lance and ſhort Piſtoll, he ſhall haue a caſe of long French Piſtols of full two foot barrell, but not with French locks (for they are oft out of temper, nor knowes euery ſimple and raw Souldier how to handle them) but with good ſtrong Snaphaunces or fire-lockes: they ſerue for the ſame vſe which the former doe, onely they doe not charge fully ſo farre home, but hauing let ſlie their Piſtols, wheele, charge and come on againe, they are of admirable benefit, and doe ſoone diſorder a battell, and being diſordered, they are great executioners.</p>
               <p>The third ſort which are <hi>Carbines,</hi> are armed Petronels, they haue for Armes a faire Burgonet or Morian on his head, a Gorget, Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of proofe, and Pouldrons to the elbowe, but no more: they haue Swords by their ſides, and at their Saddles faire Petronels, with Flaxe, Touch-boxe, Bullet-bagge, and other neceſſaries: the Horſe ſhould be a ſtrong, nimble tall Guelding, ſwift, couragious, and well ridden; hee ſhould haue a Headſtall, Raynes and Bitt, a Petrell, Cropper, and a faire Buffe Saddle of the Morocco faſhion: the vſe of them is as Muſquets amongſt Pikes, for they wing the Launces or Piſtolleirs, and deliuer their volleys further off, and when Battels are broken, they are great executioners.</p>
               <p>The laſt ſort are the <hi>Light-horſe,</hi> whoſe Armes are a Morian or Steele cap for his head, a Gorget, and a light paire of Curaces onely, or elſe a Iacke, a Plate coat, or a Shirt of Male, in his right hand a ſlender Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſtaſſe, and at his Saddle pommell a caſe of ſhort Piſtols: his horſe ſhould bee of a fine light, nimble, trotting Guelding of a middle ſize, and well ridden, his furniture a ſmall Headſtall, Raynes and Snaffle, a light Scotch Saddle, a Petterell, and a Crooper: their vſe is to gallop foorth and to diſcouer, to charge vpon looſe wings of Shot, to ſearch<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14641:47"/>and find out vnknowne paſſages, and when Battels are broken, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the chaſe, and to finiſh vp the execution.</p>
               <p>To theſe the Low-countries haue produced another ſort of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which their experience there haue found out to be of notable vſe, and they call them <hi>Dragoons,</hi> which I know not whether I may tearme them Foot-Horſe-men, or Horſe-Footmen: for they are Muſquetiers on horſebacke, and are imployed for the taking and maintaining, or at leaſt for preuenting the enemy from taking of Paſſages or Foords which leade ouer Riuers: Theſe mounted Muſquetiers are euer eleuen in a raunge, and when they come to the Paſſage, ten of them doe alight, and the eleuenth holdeth the Horſes, which threeding their bridles one into another, is very orderly done, and with great ſpeed; and when they come to remount againe, they finde their horſes in readineſſe for them. The Bodies or whole companies euer conſiſt of one hundred &amp; ten men, that is to ſay, an hundred for Seruice, &amp; ten to take charge of the Horſes.</p>
               <p>In Horſe-Troupes the common Souldier is <hi>Sentinell</hi> as in the Foot-company, neither is there any difference (more then the Horſe) betweene them and the foot <hi>Sentinels,</hi> either in order or dutie: they haue alſo their Companies deuided into <hi>Camarados</hi> or Fellowſhips, which march, cabin, and feed together; two <hi>Camarados</hi> make a Squadron, which Squadron is euer commanded by a <hi>Corporall,</hi> and the Office of the
<hi>Corporall</hi> of Horſe containeth in all points the full duties of both the <hi>Corporall</hi> and <hi>Serieant</hi> of foot. The
<hi>Quarter-maſter</hi> of Horſe is the ſame which the <hi>Harbinger</hi> or <hi>Furrier</hi> of the Foot is: the <hi>Trumpet</hi> the ſame which the
<hi>Drum</hi> &amp; <hi>Phiph</hi> is, onely differing in the tearmes and ſounds of the Inſtrument: for the firſt point of warre is <hi>Butte ſella,</hi> Clap on your ſaddles; <hi>Mounte Cauallo,</hi> mount on horſeback; <hi>Tucquet,</hi> march; <hi>Carga, carga,</hi> an Alarme to charge; <hi>Ala Standardo,</hi> a retrait, or retire to your Colours;
<hi>Auquet,</hi> to the watch, or a diſcharge for the watch, beſides diuers other points, as Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Cals, Summons, all which are moſt neceſſary for euery Souldier both to know and obey.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Clerke</hi> of the Troupe is the ſame that the
<hi>Clerke</hi> of a Band of Foot is, and the <hi>Cornet</hi> or
<hi>Guydon</hi> is the ſame that the <hi>Enſigne</hi> on foot is, and he ought euer to haue two or three faithfull &amp; valiant friends in his Range, which in all charges will haue an extraordinary care of his Colours, which is the Captaines honour, and the Companies ſafetie. Now to ſpeake a little of the <hi>Guydon</hi> or Colours themſelues, howſoeuer in our latter times either by pride or ignorance they haue been infinitly abuſed (euery man taking vpon him to carry what he pleaſeth, &amp; in what forme he pleaſeth) yet it is moſt certain that no man vnder the degree of a <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neret</hi> may carry them ſquare, but they muſt bee of Damaske, either with Deuiſe or without, three foot deep at the top, and ſo narrower to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, which muſt be with two corners or peakes, which whenſoeuer he is made a
<hi>Baron,</hi> or <hi>Knight Banneret,</hi> thoſe corners are cut away, &amp; the <hi>Guydon</hi> is made ſquare: theſe Colours are carried vpon a Lance, and are in length full two yards or better: this Gentleman which carrieth this<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14641:48"/>
                  <hi>Cornet</hi> hath all the Priuiledges which an <hi>Enſigne</hi> of Foot hath, and in his Captaine and Lieutenants abſence commandeth the Company, and by either of their deaths ought in right to bee aduaunced into their places. In the Quarter hee is lodged as well as his Captaine, and in all Marches hath the leading of the middle File, &amp; followeth next after his Captaine.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of a Troupe of Horſe ſuiteth in all things with a <hi>Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of Foot, and in the abſence of the Captaine commandeth with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power, and hath the principall place in all Marches, but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Captaine he hath then but the ſecond place; and as his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine marcheth on the Head, ſo he marcheth at the Reare going on vpon Seruice; but in returning backe from Seruice, the Captaine marcheth at the Reare, and the Lieutenant on the Head: for the moſt honourableſt place is alwayes that which is neereſt to the enemy, and where he is moſt likelieſt to charge; which being proper and moſt peculiar to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the ſecond place muſt needs conſequently follow to bee the right of the Lieutenant.</p>
               <p>A Horſeman (not hauing leaue to aſſault) hath no part in the ſacke or pillage of a towne, for it is a ſeruice to which his Horſe cannot approch, and if for the greedineſſe of gaine hee forſake his Mounture without leaue, then he deſerueth no bootie but puniſhment: yet if his horſe ſhall happen to be ſlaine (or any other honourable meanes ſet him on foot) he may then put himſelfe into a Foot band, and by a lawfull authoritie both proceed to the Aſſault, and alſo by good right receiue what benefit ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhall redound to his fortune. Many other circumſtances and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies there be, which becauſe I ſhall haue occaſion to touch more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in other places, therefore I will omit them in this Epiſtle, and onely conclude with theſe inferiour Offices of the Caualerie, which although I haue but poynted at, yet being duely weighed with thoſe of the Foot, which are more largely diſcourſed, I hope there will little or nothing bee found wanting which may giue to any reaſonable mind a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſatisfaction.</p>

It is his Office alſo to ſee ſufficient prouiſion made of all ſorts of <hi>Carriages</hi> either for the Field or Fleete, and that they be of right ſhape, ſtrength and faſt binding; He ſhall cauſe prouiſion to bee made for great ſtore of good and ſound <hi>Axletrees,</hi> of which the beſt are thoſe of Yengh, the ſecond beſt, thoſe of Elme, and thoſe which are tollerable are of Aſh; there muſt bee choice of <hi>Wheeles</hi> well lined with yron and double bound with yron, and ſtrong Nailes whoſe heads are ſquare, thicke and high, and vnto all theſe he ſhall haue good ſtoore of <hi>Ladles</hi> of ſeuerall quantities and ſeuerall lengths, <hi>Ramers</hi> ſutable to the boares of all manner of Peeces, and <hi>Coines</hi> with which to raiſe vp the breech of the Peece higher or lower as either his will or occaſion ſhall direct and lead him; and beſides all theſe, it is his Office to ſee prouided great ſtore of yron <hi>Crowes, Shouels, Mattocks, Spades, Leauers, Gabions, Baskets, Ropes,</hi> and <hi>Cordage</hi> of all ſize,
<hi>Chaines,</hi> old <hi>Iron, Nailes, Flints,</hi> and what elſe is proper for the charging of murthering Peeces.</p>
               <p>This Officer is to haue an eſpeciall care and vigilant reſpect to any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualtie or danger which may happen by fier, (for they are much Incident and liable thereto) and many miſerable and tragicall iſſues haue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from a careleſſe looking to the ſame, therefore the preuention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of muſt not alone reſt in his owne boſome, but in his diligence and watchfulnes ouer others, and to ſee that they place euery thinge ſo ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vnder ſo ſure a Guard, that all ſuch miſcheiues (by probabilitie) may be preuented, and euery <hi>Canoniere</hi> ſo ready in his duty, that through his good examples and neceſſary prouiſions nothing may happen to breede an after repentance; and whereſouer theſe prouiſions ſhall either march or abide, he ſhall be ſure to haue a guard of expert Souldiers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer about them, both to repulſe the enemie and keepe others off from offering any anoyance vnto them. It is his Office to looke to the goodnes and ſoundnes of euery Peece and that they be free from cracks, galls or flawes, whereby the Peece may be in danger to breake, ſince no ſuch accident can happen without the eminent perill and diſtruction of many men which are about it; and queſtionleſſe in mine owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I haue knowne many lamentable and Tragicke diſaſters which haue chanced through ſuch eſcapes, as once I knew a drunken Canoniere who vpon the diſcharge of a Peece throwing his Linſtocke into a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell of powder which ſtood behind him, blew vp both himſelfe, the whole poope of the Shippe, and diuers others which were about him: Alſo I knew a another Shippe not far from
<hi>Ramekins</hi> in <hi>Zeland,</hi> which by the breaking of a Peece was ſunke in the Sea, and loſt both men and goods to a wonderfull great valew, the like hapned at the beſeidging of the Forte at <hi>Breſt</hi> in
<hi>Brittany</hi> and diuers braue Gentlemen were<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14641:49"/>burnt and ſpoyled, ſo that I conclude theſe accidents being ſo ordinary and incident to happen, it is very behouefull for the Maſter Gunner ſo far foorth as lies in his power to haue a watchfull and carefull eie to the preuention of the ſame.</p>
               <p>In ſome armies and ſome diſciplines the,
<hi>Fire-maſter</hi> and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Gunner</hi> are all one without any difference or alteration either in authority or duty, but generally through all armies it is not ſo, but they are deuided and made two ſeuerall and diſtinct places, the <hi>Fier-Maſter</hi> being he that hath the art how to make and compound all manner of Fier-workes, and hath the charge for the vſe and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame, and the <hi>Maſter-Gunner</hi> only medleth with the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and the other Engines which I haue already reherſed; but theſe latter times in which men haue more greedy and free ſpirits then in the former times, producing men which had a ſufficient vnderſtanding in both the miſteries or arts: they haue for the ſauing of double fees and double wages, brought theſe two Officers into one, and comprehended them vnder the greater Title, which is the <hi>Maſter-Gunner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Fire-maſter</hi> then (as I ſaid) is an Officer which hath Intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and to doe only with the making, mixing and compounding of all manner of fire-workes or wild-fiers, which both in Land-fights, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in Sea fights are of wonderfull great importance, as in all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults and ioyning of Battels, in <hi>Mines,</hi> in <hi>Trenches,</hi> and in the fiering of Townes and Pauillions, in the grapling of <hi>Ships, Boordings,</hi> or ſeting fier on the <hi>Sailes, Tackles,</hi> or any part which it toucheth, ſo that as the
<hi>Fier-Maſter</hi> maketh and compoundeth theſe wild-fiers, ſo alſo he hath the ordring and diſpoſing of them; giuing commandment when, where, and in what manner to vſe them, for, then wild-fier there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the warrs of more eſpeciall vſe, neither is there any thinge found of greater violence either to deſtroy or breed affright and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the enemie, for it is a fier not to be quenched, and burneth with that moſt Implacable fury, that being once fixed, it neuer leaueth till all be conſumed that is round about it; it is fometimes fixed vnto Arrowes &amp; ſo ſhot into townes, amongſt Tents or where any occaſions are offerd: It is ſometimes made vp in balls and caſt amongſt the aſſaults either at a breatch, the entrance of a gate, or where any preſſe or throng are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, and ſometimes it is caſt abroad and at large in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed manner, when men will ſcower a Trench or Ditch, or driue men out of a ſtrength which is open and weakely guarded; and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Fier-master</hi> muſt not be without very great ſtore of <hi>Arrowes, Balls,</hi> and

               <p>To conclude, theſe Officers (whether they be ioynt or ſeperate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be two, or but one, yet they ought to be exceeding Ingenious, very carefull, daring and faithfull, for they haue much to doe with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, more with miſchances, and moſt of all with perills and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: As for their Truſt it is ſo great that the very health and ſafety of Armies lye continually in their fingers.</p>

               <p>He is an Officer at whoſe hands are required a two fold dutie, the one of <hi>Safetie,</hi> the other of <hi>Hurt</hi> or <hi>Annoyance:</hi> for to his friends he muſt be a ſtrength and ſafeguard, and to his enemies a plague and miſchiefe.

<hi>Mathematickes,</hi> and all <hi>Geometricall</hi> rules and proportions, and that he haue the authority of long practiſe &amp; ſound knowledge to countenance and defend whatſoeuer hee vndertaketh, for in his Braine and Breſt, and the ſtrength of his profeſſion conſiſteth the ſafetie of the whole Armie which is lodg'd within the compaſſe of his intrenchments, for his Art muſt be their wall of defence, and by the ſquare of his iudgement is their ſecuritie loſt or made perfect.</p>
               <p>When therefore the plot of Ground for emcamping is appointed and choſen out by the Lord Marſhall, and that the Quarter-maſter hath deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it into ſundry large quarters for the generall receit of the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, then ſhall the <hi>Trench-maſter</hi> forthwith ſtake out the vttermoſt verge and extreameſt part thereof for the beſt aduantage of the Campe, and the greateſt hurt and annoyance that can be to the enemy, which done, according to the beſt proportions which will agree with the nature of the ground, and thoſe formes into which the Marſhall and Quarter-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters haue formed the Campe, he ſhall draw his Intrenchments and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, girdling and ſurrounding the ſame in ſuch manner about, that the enemy may in no wiſe make any attempt thereupon without his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine loſſe and hindrance, and making all his approches and entrances to the Campe with ſuch intricate Art, and vnder ſuch Guards and defences of its owne ſtrength, that the enemy may neither haue hope nor abilitie at any time to giue vpon the ſame, but when hee ſhall returne backe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſt and laden both with ſhame and diſhonour.</p>
               <p>I haue in mine owne experience knowne ſome principall great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, as namely Sir <hi>William Pelham</hi> (a noble and renowned Souldier) who was Lord Marſhall in my Lord of <hi>Leiceſters</hi> time in the Low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and after him Sir <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> who both by experience and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation were wonderfully skilfull in this kind; and notwithſtanding both of them had moſt excellent Officers vnder them, and men of exceeding rare knowledge in theſe practiſes, yet in theſe great &amp; important affaires<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14641:51"/>of Fortifications and Aſſurances in guarding of the Campe, they ſtill performed all things by their owne proper Commaund and directions, neither could any danger (how eminent or certaine ſoeuer) either in the viewes, approches, or diſcouery of places fit to be fortified, deterre or keepe them backe, but notwithſtanding they both receiued many great, and almoſt deadly wounds, yet ſtill they performed thoſe ſeruices in their owne perſons. But this was the perfection of their knowledge and the abſolute rareneſſe of their courage (which is not alwaies found out in men of their high place and commaundement) therefore it is expedient that in euery Army there ſhould be this diſtinct and eſpecial officer, both for the generall ſafetie of the Souldier, that hee may march without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to the approches &amp; outward skirts of the campe, which (as it were) outfaceth the enemy, and alſo being there, may be defended againſt any <hi>Sallies, Stratagems,</hi> or other annoyances, as alſo to haue a freedome of power to mount their Ordnance at pleaſure, and to make <hi>Mounts</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Artillery; alſo to raiſe <hi>Caualiers,</hi> to digge <hi>Mines</hi> vnder earth or running

               <p>This officer muſt haue a ready and pregnant skill in caſting out the true proportion of all manner of <hi>Trenches,</hi> forming the depths and breadths thereof according to Art and the imployment for which they were firſt framed. It behoues him to know how to forme and modell out all ſorts of Bulwarks, making them large and maſſie, how to make election of his earth for toughneſſe and firmeneſſe, how to ramme it, pile it, and in caſe the mould be light and ſubtill, then in what ſort to temper and mixe it, and to bring it to a body that ſhall be tough, cloſſe, and ſollid; then how to caſt his ditches both about and betweene each ſeuerall Bulwark, how to frame his <hi>Gabions, Parapets, Tenazas, Tyzeras, Dients,</hi> and
<hi>Caſamats,</hi> how to make his <hi>Ports</hi> or <hi>Gates,</hi> and in what ſort to fortifie them with <hi>Draw-bridges, Rastels, Senaceneſcas,</hi> or <hi>Portcluyſes;</hi> then where to make his
<hi>Terraplene</hi> or places of <hi>Retrait;</hi> and laſtly how to modell and ſmooth out the <hi>Campania raza</hi> or plaine Champaine without all the workes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, by which the enemy may haue no ground of aduantage wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to diſturbe the Campe, Towne, Fort, or other place which hee hath fortified.</p>
               <p>To conclude, it is the office of this <hi>Trench</hi> or
<hi>Engine-master</hi> to be skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and experienced in all manner of Plots and Platformes whatſoeuer, and that he is able by his owne vnderſtanding and induſtry to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date &amp; apply himſelfe to any kind of Situation or piece of ground what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, knowing how either to fortifie or ſupplant it vpon the firſt view, being therto called either by his place or any eſpeciall commandement.</p>
               <p>In <hi>France</hi> two Noblemen of great and good Blood, the one called Count <hi>Pedro</hi> of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the other the Lord of
<hi>Brey,</hi> haue been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding famous, &amp; much commended for the ſingularitie of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14641:52"/>in this excellent Art, and in our Nation I doubt not but thoſe two I firſt ſpake of, namely,
<hi>General Vere,</hi> and <hi>Marſhall Pelham,</hi> are notable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents to all ages that ſhall follow, of the rare and hidden perfection which is contained in the ſame: or ſhould the dulneſſe of our laſt times grow ſo blockiſh or ſtupid, as to forget men of their Fame and Merit, yet to doe this Iland honor, I could reuine the names of two others, who in this Art haue not been ouerrunne by any ſtrangers, that is to ſay, the two honorable Knights, Sir <hi>Richard Hanſard,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Ioſias Bodley,</hi> being both famous Schollers, expert Souldiers, and rare Mathematicians; and indeed hauing had that exquiſite benefit by Trauel, that few in their daies could outſtrip them, eſpecially Sir <hi>Richard Hanſard,</hi> who in the warres of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, Poland,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Tranſyluania,</hi> had reaped that knowledge and experience which brought backe to his King and Countrie a large and plentiful tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and to himſelfe a moſt worthy and fit imployment. Neither was the other much inferior, who in all the warres of his time was neuer out of action, but ſo ioyned his ſtudie with practiſe and experience, that hee bound his Countrey infinitely vnto him; and howſoeuer reſpected, yet queſtionleſſe none euer yet better deſerued.</p>
               <p>I could here enter into a very large field, and find a world of excellent plants, which grew and flouriſhed in this Art, as namely,
<hi>Dexter, Diggs, Smith,</hi> and many others who were good Schollers, moſt excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians, and rare Enginiers, but the diſcourſe of their works would aske rather a whole Volume then the laſt part of this ſhort Epiſtle. Let it then ſuffice, that the <hi>Trench-master</hi> or
<hi>Engineir</hi> (of whom I haue intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) hauing the perfections already recited, and to them added a ſpeciall circumſpction, to regard both the outward and inward ſituation of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and how to prouide remedies againſt euery annoyance, whether it conſiſt in Altitudes, Longitudes, or Latitudes, or in any other frame or forme whatſoeuer, that then without all queſtion he is a man of skill: and whenſoeuer he is called vpon by any eſpeciall commandement, he may without amazement take vpon him the Protection of the Armie.</p>

               <p>To come then to the perticular charge and nature of his Office hee hath (as before I ſaid) the Charge and Commandmend of all <hi>Horſes, Mules, Garrons, Waggons, Carts, Sleads</hi> and other implements whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, to carry &amp; conuey all the needfull Baggage either of <hi>Meate, Drinke,</hi> or <hi>Apparrell</hi> which any way dependeth vpon the Armie: and not only appointeth vnder him all ſuch miniſters as ſhall ſee the ſame mounted and laden out of euery ſeuerall quarter, but alſo being ſo furniſhed, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them in aray and Rankes as he purpoſeth they ſhall March, deſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euery man to his place and order, which no man ſhall dare or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to breake, vpon paine of either hauing ſo much money defaulted and taken from his wages, or elſe ſome other bodily puniſhment at the diſcretion of the Waggon-Maſter. And that theſe Neceſſaries or Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage of the Armie may be conueyed with greater ſafetie, the Officers of the Horſe and Commanders of Infantrie, are to allow vnto the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon-Maſter a good and ſufficient Guard both of Horſe and Foote to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the

               <p>Theſe Shot ſhall ſcower before the baggage, that if any of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſtragling Horſe ſhall offer to make Incurſſions vpon them, they may inſtantly reſiſt them and beate them backe to their maine bodies: But if it be ſo that the armie march in a place of ſafety and where there is no danger of the enemie, then ſhall the luggage haue their place in the middeſt of the vauntguard alwaies, with a ſtronge guard of pikes and ſhot continually about it, and the Waggon-maſter in the head thereof to giue directions vpon any alteration, which will be very commodious for the Souldier, who by this forwardnes of the Baggage ſhall not ſtand to waite and expect, but finde his Tent pitcht aſſoone as he commeth, and all things which can accomodate his wearines to be ready and prepared; Laſtly it is the Office of the Waggon-maſter to looke to the goodnes and ſufficiencie of all the Waggons and other carriages which hee hath in his charge, to ſee that the bodies be whole and tyght, the wheeles ſtronge and well bound, the axletrees vnſtrained and well clouted, and all the harnes and implements belonging to the cattell for draught that it be firme, new and vntatterd; and to this end he ſhall euer haue neare and about him men of theſe trades, as
<hi>Codders,</hi> or <hi>Knackers, Cartwrights, Smiths</hi> and the like, with whatſoeuer is needfull for their vſe (which hee ſhall receiue by appointment from the maſter of the Ordnance,) and ſo he ſhall keepe euery thinge perfect and in good order, both to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls good, the Souldiers profit, and his owne reputation, for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſome other ſmaller thinges depend vpon his knowledge; yet theſe I haue already ſhewed, are the maine ſubſtance of his cares, and the full duties which are expected in his Office.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O little am I knowne to your Lordſhip, that much I dare not preſume from you, only that honeſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe which dare guide mee, will I hope (ſeconded by your vertue) informe you, that nothing either in this Epiſtle I offer, or in the end that I aſſume, will, or deſerue your contempt or amazement. <hi>Caeſar</hi> (though in a goodlier Table) was content to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe himſelfe by the like figure; and if I, labouring to be his Scholler, repeat what leſſons I haue learned in our latter conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, be it your goodnes to vouchſafe me hearing, and though the Map be much too ſcant to expreſſe the great world I would decipher, yet may your noble acceptation make vnto it ſo perfect a Scale, that without any intricacie or hardneſſe you may take the vttermoſt meaſure of all my purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I am conducted in this Epiſtle to the Office and dutie of the
<hi>Forrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master,</hi> or <hi>Prouidador de la Cauallo,</hi> being another great officer depending vpon the <hi>Lieutenant-Generall</hi> of the Horſe, and from him is to receiue a competent Guard of Light-horſmen or Dragoones mixt with ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Foot-Pike and Shot, which may protect and defend his Forragers when they goe foorth to ſeeke and prouide all things neceſſary for the reliefe and accommodation of the Horſe-quarter.</p>
               <p>The eſpeciall dutie of this <hi>Forrage-maſter</hi> is (after he hath his Guard in readineſſe) by the ſound of a Trumpet, to call together all his Forragers or ſeruants, which are to be imployed in this labour, being a compound Rabble of all manner of meane &amp; inferior ſeruants, as Horſemens <hi>Boyes,</hi> Footmens <hi>Boyes, Boores,</hi> common <hi>Lackeys,</hi> and the like; and for ſuch Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14641:55"/>as haue no boies, they muſt <hi>Alternis vicibus</hi> (being of one <hi>Camerade</hi>) ſerue themſelues, ſome at one time, ſome at another, till euery man haue done his perfect dutie. When theſe are thus gathered together, they ſhall be armed both for defence &amp; ſeruice, with Sythes, Sickles, Hooks, Axes, Browne bils (if the Army haue any ſuch weapon) or elſe with old Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts, or the like neceſſary tooles, as alſo good Swords and other engins, ſome to mow and cut downe <hi>Hay, Straw, young Corne, Pulſe, Graſse,</hi> or the like, ſome to hew downe boughes and young watlings to make Cabins, and ſome to force dores and windowes, or to teare and pull down what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer withſtands them. Being thus accoutred, the <hi>Forrage-maſter</hi> ſhall mixe with them a conuenient number of <hi>Cariages, Sleads, Tumbrels,</hi> and horſes of burthen, to bring home ſuch prouiſions as he ſhall get, and then putting them into the heart or center of his Guard; hee as their chiefe leader ſhall conduct them forth to ſuch conuenient places as he knoweth will affoord him thoſe neceſſary commodities which hee ſeeketh, and herein he ſhall haue a great reſpect to the time and ſeaſon of the yeare, as if it bee in the Spring, then he ſhall ſeeke for the earlieſt graſſe, the tender yong blades of Wheat, Rye, or any thing that hath bin preſerued greene all the Winter, as the leaues of Coleworts or Cabbages, the rootes and branches of Carats, or any other ſweet root that is pleaſant and not ſharpe or biting: for of theſe horſes will feed, grow fat, and the more they labour, the more wholeſome it is for their bodies. If it bee in the Summer, he ſhall ſeek out for young Hay or Graſſe ready to be mowne, for Corne of all kinds which is halfe ripe, &amp; for any Pulſe that is ſprung vp although it be not codded. If it be in the Harueſt, then he ſhall ſeeke forth all kind of ripe corne or pulſe, eſpecially Oats, Wheat and Barley: for the eares will feed the horſe, and the ſtraw will ſerue for litter; for ripe Rye it will make a horſe ſcoure and ſhoot, and the leſſe he eateth, the better it will bee both for his body and ſeruice. Laſtly, if it bee in the Winter, then ſhall the <hi>Forrage-maſter</hi> ſeeke into Barnes and houſes, and no graine, come, hay or ſtraw commeth amiſſe whatſoeuer, ſo that as ſoone as he hath gotten a proportion ſutable to his deſire, hee ſhall then cauſe it to bee truſt vp and laid into the
<hi>Cariages,</hi> and ſo being brought home to the Campe, it is the
<hi>Forrage-maſters</hi> office to ſee it equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into euery ſeuerall Horſe-quarter. But if this ceſſement or taxation of horſe-forrage be drawne from the friend, then it is the office of the
<hi>Forrage-maſter</hi> to Rate the Boores, and both to ſet priſes of their graine, and all other horſe-prouiſions, and alſo appoint in what manner it ſhall be brought to the Campe, and then how to be diſtributed to euery quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without partialitie or extortion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Forragers</hi> are to attend vpon the
<hi>Forrage-maſter,</hi> in all theſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches after a decent and comely ſort, that is to ſay, they ſhall all goe out together, and not ſtragling or diſperſt one from another; for if the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my doe lie any thing neere at hand, it is the principall aduantage hee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for to cut off ſuch looſe deſperates; and therfore at the ſound of the Trumpet they ſhall all march together (guarded as aforeſaid) and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14641:55"/>till their labour and ſeruice be finiſhed without any ſeparation, for feare of ſudden ſlaughter or ſurpriſe, then which there is not an action of greater danger: for if any of theſe looſe fellowes ſhould happen to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoners, and ſo the enemy wreſt from them ſome ſecret matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the Army, it might be a miſchief to which a thouſand of their liues were not able to make a conuenient recompenſe, &amp; the aduauntage which the foe might gaine thereby, doth ſo farre outweigh all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of their future ſeruice, that they haue nothing but curſes and diſdaine to liue with them euer after.</p>
               <p>As thus the <hi>Forrage-master</hi> is to ſee them march foorth together and likewiſe keepe together, without diſordering the body by any quitting or ſtealing out of their Ranks; ſo is he likewiſe to haue care that they all come home together, for theſe <hi>Forragers</hi> haue many times that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of diſpoſition within them, that if the eye of the chiefe Officer once neglect them (ſo as they can make eſcape from the Company) preſently they hide themſelues in paſſages and obſcure waies, diſguiſing their faces with Scarfes or cloſe Caskes, and ſo lie in wait to rob and ſpoile their owne fellowes, who being newly arriued at their quarter, and intic't by the pleaſantnes of the ayre to walke abroad and view the bounds or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Countrey adiacent, are preſently by an aduantagious blow, or an vndreampt of bullet on the ſudden knockt downe to the earth, and ſo by our owne ſtraglers diſpoyled, robbed, and ſometimes murdered; which to preuent, there is nothing ſo auaileable as the diligent care and vigilance of the <hi>Forrage-master,</hi> whoſe eye is the onely ſalue which can cure theſe miſchiefes: for by looking to their eſcapes, and moſt ſeuerely puniſhing all thoſe which ſhall firſt attempt to offend in this nature, they will quickly bee reduced to order, and feare, which is the terror of euery baſe and vnder-valued courage, will like a ſharp Bit raine them in, &amp; keep miſchiefe in deſpight of his owne will from running into diſorder.</p>
               <p>It is alſo the office of this <hi>Forrage-master,</hi> when he approcheth any of thoſe places where he findeth (in part or whole) the commodities he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, to haue a circumſpect regard to the ſituation of the place, and in what manner thoſe commodities grow there, as alſo what aduantage the ground or any place neighbouring neere vnto the ſame, may haue for the placing and concealing of any ambuſh or other ſtratageme which may put himſelfe and his company in danger, and finding any ſuſpition or doubt thereof; it is his part preſently to collect what ground of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage may againe relieue himſelfe if any ſuch vnlookt for accident ſhould happen; and hauing armed himſelfe againſt the worſt of all diſaſtrous ſuppoſitions, he ſhall yet notwithſtanding dare to engage either himſelfe or his company further then he hath a ſafe and aſſured retrait, whereby to bring them off in deſpight of all the politike engines which the ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the enemy can deuiſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, when the <hi>Forrage-maſter</hi> bringeth hom his Bootie (which is all neceſſary prouiſions belonging to the Horſe-troupes) he ſhall (before it be ſhared) make in his owne account a true value and eſtimation thereof,<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14641:56"/>and if he find it bee in any great meaſure or large quantitie, ſo that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance amounteth to a very plentifull ouerplus, then ſhall hee firſt of all deduct out of the whole Groſſe a competent proportion to ſerue all the Troups of horſe for the preſent, and then (the neceſſitie of their occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the profit of the Armie deſiring ſuch frugalitie) he ſhall cauſe the reſt to be ſtored and laid vp in ſome conuenient prouiſion houſe, and thence weekely (by his inferiour Officers) haue it deliuered out to the Clerks of the Troups without any lauiſh expence, or vnthrifty conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame: and queſtionleſſe a better care cannot be preſerued, for I haue knowne in mine owne experience, when at our firſt ſitting downe before a place beſieged, comming vnexpected and before ſuch prouiſions could bee taken from our poſſeſſions, wee haue found wondrous great plentie of all ſorts of theſe accommodations, yet hauing careleſly waſted and conſumed the ſame, without remembring any neceſſities that might ariſe from future times; and being by the ſtubborneneſſe of the enemy fixt to the continuance of a lingring Siege, we haue vndergone ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury and want, that it hath bin queſtionable whether the Beſieger or the Beſieged haue ſuſtained at the hand of <hi>Fortune</hi> the greater calamitie, whereas the ſmalleſt ſpark of Care in the beginning, had fixt ſuch a ſure nayle in the wheele of <hi>Fate,</hi> that nothing would haue troubled vs which had the leaſt ſhadow or ſhape of Neceſſitie.</p>
               <p>Many other complementall Obſeruations might bee added to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this office, but being partly immateriall to my purpoſe, and partly ſuch neere dependants to the things already diſcuſſed, that the one is no more but an expoſition of the other, I will neither bee tedious to your Lordſhip, nor a breaker of order in the method I haue vndertaken, but ſhut vp mine Epiſtle with this Concluſion, That whoſoeuer doth as much in this Office as is already deliuered, albe hee doe not all that can be imagined, yet he ſhall doe as much as any neceſſary Reaſon can be expected.</p>

               <p>The next Officer aſſending in this warlike legend (and with which I am to account in this Epiſtle) is that of the <hi>Victuall-Master, Prouant-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> or <hi>Purueyor</hi> of victuals for the whole Body of the Armie, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede a principall and eminent perſon holding a place both of great Truſt, Care and Eſtimation; his generall dependance is vpon the Armie and the <hi>Generalls</hi> eſpeciall Commandments, but the perticular looketh moſt at the <hi>Treaſurer;</hi> for he ſupplyeth all thoſe neceſſities which he is not able to furniſh.</p>
               <p>The ellection of this man ought to be out of the beſt ſort of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, hauing in him both the dignity of Blood and the glory of vertue, with the one to feele and pitty mens wants and extreamities, and with the other to giue a ſpeedy, honeſt and an wholeſome remedy: he ought to be endued with three eſpeciall vertues, as firſt <hi>Wiſdome</hi> (which he is to exerciſe in making his prouiſions,) then <hi>Temperance,</hi> (which is to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne him in the expence of his commodities according to order) and

To conclude, he muſt in no wiſe be a hard harted or couetous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for Couetouſnes is the mother of many vices, and if this Officer, either to gaine at cheape Rates by vnſound and inſufficient victuals, or to keepe them (till the extreamity of times doe compell the Souldier to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them) ſtore them till they rot and turne to putrifaction, and then force them on thoſe where deniall can not be heard nor relieued; then belieue it, this man doth his Prince and Country moſt wicked ſeruice; hath the curſe of the liuing and the blood of many ſlaughter'd Soules hanging at his elbow, for from this ground (aboue others) doe mutenies and deuiſions amongſt Souldiers ariſe, which is ſeldome apeas'd but with death; and from hence in mine owne experience I haue obſerued two ſuch inſurrections, that they ſtarted the whole Armie with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Touching the nature and qualitie of this Officer, he is to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion for the Armie of all kind of victualls whatſoeuer, carefully and faithfuly, and for that purpoſe is to haue at euery <hi>Rendiuous</hi> or place of Garriſſon, a fit and conuenient <hi>Store-Houſe,</hi> in which to pile vp and acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the ſame, whether it be <hi>Bread, Bisket, Cheeſe, Butter, Fiſh, Beefe, Bacon, Meale, Peaſe</hi> or any other prouiſion; which according to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants from the Superior Officers, (nominating the number of men in liſt of euery company) he ſhall deliuer out proportionably according to ſuch a rate for euery man <hi>Per diem,</hi> and being ſtil aſſured to keepe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions within the compaſſe of the Souldiers common allowance of ordinary lendings, as for example; If the Souldiers lendings be after the Rate of Three Shillings by the weeke, then ſhall the victuall-maſter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him victualls at the rate of foure pence by the day and a penny for drinke, which amounts to two ſhillings and eleauen pence the weeke, the remainder when the Captaine commeth to rekcon with the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, by the <hi>Victuallers</hi> certificates ſhall (or at leaſt ſhould) be an arrerage due to the Souldier; and thus according to the proportion of any wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and in this expending of victualls it is to be ſuppoſed that euery <hi>Victuall-Master</hi> ought to accommodate his victualls vnto the place in which they are ſpent; as if it be in Gariſon or ſetled Campe, then hee ſhall ſpend thoſe victualls which are worſt for carriage and moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome for the Souldier to dreſſe; as Butter, Bread, Fiſh or the like, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his plenty be great, and then he may let them haue two daies fleſh,<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14641:57"/>as ether <hi>Beefe</hi> or
<hi>Bacon,</hi> for Sundaies and Thurſdaies; two daies <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> as on Monday &amp; Tueſday; one day <hi>Cheeſe</hi> as Wenſday; and two dayes
<hi>Fiſh</hi> as Friday and Satterday.</p>
               <p>But if it be in Marching or Iourneying, then hee ſhall giue them the victuals which is moſt eaſie for carriage, and the longeſt laſting, as <hi>Bisket, Beefe</hi> ready boyld, <hi>Cheeſe,</hi> or the like. Now for the proportions how much conueniently may ſuſtaine a man a day (though they muſt be rated according to the plenty of the ſtore and the prizes by which they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained) yet for example ſake, and according to the experience of thoſe warres which I haue ſeene, halfe a pound of
<hi>Bisket,</hi> and halfe a pound of <hi>Butter</hi> hath beene at fit daies proportion for one man, or a pound of <hi>Bread</hi> and halfe a pound of
<hi>Beefe</hi> or elſe <hi>Bacon;</hi> a full daies proportion, or otherwiſe halfe a pound of <hi>Bisket</hi> and a pound of <hi>Cheeſe;</hi> likewiſe a pound of <hi>Bisket</hi> and a <hi>Poore-Iohn</hi> betweene two men for one day, or two pound of <hi>Bisket</hi> and a <hi>Haberdine</hi> betweene foure men for one day is a great proportion, halfe a pound of
<hi>Bisket</hi> and foure herrings is one mans allowance for one day, and ſo is a quart of <hi>Peaſe</hi> boyld, or a pint of <hi>Rice</hi> with the ordinary allowance of <hi>Bisket.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Victuall-Maſter,</hi> whilſt he is in the friend Country may ſend forth his warrants or potents for the bringing in of all manner of victualls at their ordinary prizes, and in ſuch manner (if the Souldier receiue his wages in money) he ſhall retaile it backe without aduantage; for no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action in any wiſe ſhould be taken on the Souldier, eſpecially in caſe of foode, for it is the nouriſher of his ſtrength and courage, and that being abated he can neither march well nor fight well; as thus victualls are brought in by the Friend, ſo being in the enemies Land, it is the Office of the <hi>Victuler</hi> to conſider the qualitie and ſeaſon of the place, for if the Country it ſelfe be rich and well furniſhed, and therewithall ſuddenly Inuaded; no doubt but great plenty of prouiſions will be found, vpon which it is his Office to ceaze, and withall care to ſee it ordered and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued for the beſt benefit and vſe of the Armie, and to that end hee is continually to haue attending on him in good pay at leaſt ſixe Subſtitutes or vnder Officers to keepe accounts and deliuer out prouiſions, beſides good and ſufficient <hi>Bakers, Butchers, Fiſhmongers, Hucſters</hi> and <hi>Coopers,</hi> beſides <hi>Porters</hi> and luggage <hi>Carriers,</hi> to rummage and order things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his directions, and doubtleſſe it is found in the warres that there is greater husbandry in preſeruing things then in prouiding, ſince plenty and ſcarcity are theſe two extreames which ofteſt doe make Souldiers Waſtfull; For in Abundance it is the nature of courſe bred creatures to imagine that the ſpring hath no bottome, and in the time of penury aſſoone as the chearefulneſſe of reliefe but once ſhines vpon them, preſently the greedineſſe of their natures falls into ſuch exceſſe, that nothing but Ryot and Drunkennes is made the Steward of their expences.</p>
               <p>This only is to be cured by this worthy Officer, for his fit diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on makes the one moderate, and his skilfull preſeruations makes the other<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14641:58"/>diſcreete. And indeede to ſpeake the truth, a wiſe and iudicious <hi>Victuall-Maſter</hi> which knowes by <hi>Powdering, Turning, Cleanſing</hi> and <hi>Drying,</hi> how to keepe his victualls ſound and ſweete, from <hi>Moulding, Sowering, Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> or
<hi>Stinking,</hi> is the Souldiers beſt Phiſition, and giues him nothing but what brings health to his body, pleaſure to his taſt, and contentment to his minde.</p>
               <p>This Officer muſt be both for himſelfe and others, a skilfull and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Auditor, keeping his Bookes and Reckonings faithfully and iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both betweene himſelfe and the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> for generall and great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, betweene all ſuch as ſhall bring in prouiſions, and his vnder victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allers, but aboue all betweene his owne conſcience and the Souldiers wants, whom (vnder ſo many Colours) he may wring; that vnleſſe his owne ſoule ſpeake vnto him, there is no other <hi>Argus</hi> that can ſpie out his miſchieues: Therefore for the preuention of all wrongs, and that no cunning may walke in <hi>Truths</hi> vppermoſt Garment; there is ſtrictly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at this Officers hands a ſolemne and religious Oath, by which hee is bound to ſerue Iuſtly, vprightly, and truely in his place, hauing alwaies his Bookes of account in a readines, that whenſoeuer he ſhall bee called vpon, either by the Generall or Treaſurer, hee may with all diligence make knowne the vttermoſt depth of his actions, and declare his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and integritie both to his Prince, his Country and the Armie in which he ſerueth: neither ſhall he be more carefull of himſelfe then of his Clerkes and Inferior miniſters; prouiding that they as himſelfe doe Iuſtly in all things, and that <hi>Iniurie</hi> and <hi>Extortion</hi> lye not Bed rid or ſicke in his Office: which if he performe as he ought, then is he a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and renowned Officer, and howſoeuer his mortall part dye, yet ſhall the memory of his Immortall Goodnes ſuruiue as long as any Souldier holds his remembrance.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Bring to you (my deare Lord) in the tribute of this ſhort Epiſtle, two great Homages which I owe, the one to the memory of your noble Grandfather (to whoſe honourable fauours I was infinitly bound in my Seruice to the late Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of bleſſed memory) and the other to your worthy ſelfe (from whom I haue euer receiued that reſpect, which not to acknowledge, would hang as a Sereine or rotting Mildew vpon any thankfull nature) be pleaſed then to heare it ſpeake at your beſt leaſure, and though it haue neuer ſo rude an vtterance, yet you ſhal find it beares a worthy affection both to your Name and Honor.</p>
               <p>The Office vpon which I touch in this place (my beſt Lord) is that of the <hi>Prouost-Marſhall,</hi> which howſoeuer the
<hi>Generall</hi> (through his greatnes and priority of place) hath power to confirme and appoint, yet common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Gentleman which is deſigned therunto, is alwaies nominated and recommended by the Lord <hi>Marſhall</hi> of the field, being his vnder Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and one vnto whom is deliuered the charge and keeping of all Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents and criminall offenders whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>This Office I haue ſeene in mine experience to carry a double and two-fold eſtimation (yet rather out of corruption then true ground) men iudging of the good or euill thereof according to the worthineſſe or vnworthineſſe of the partie which held it, the honeſt, wiſe, &amp; vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding man ſwaying it with Reputation and Renowne. The fooliſh, baſe, and contemptible perſon ordering it with a regard of as much or more Imputation: But all this is fault in Election, not in Place; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the Office in it ſelfe is both worthy, neceſſary and good, a calling fit for a Gentleman of Blood and qualitie, and a degree wherein a man
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14641:59"/>may expreſſe any vertue to the life, both with applauſe and admiration. It is alſo of great profit and aduauncement (which inferres <hi>Merit</hi>) and there is knit vnto it a ſingular Truſt, which muſt euer allow of much <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Wiſdome:</hi> I cannot compare it in our ciuill gouernment to any office neerer then that of our
<hi>Vnder-Sherifes,</hi> which howſoeuer the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe is, <hi>Twiſe an Vnder-Sheriſe, euer a Knaue:</hi> yet it is but corruption that makes good the Adage; for I know many honeſt men that many yeares haue had the place, yet many times better then a world of thoſe which contemne it. But to proceed, the Gentleman which ſhould be elected to this place of
<hi>Prouost-Marſhall,</hi> would bee a man of great Iudgement and Experience in all <hi>Martiall Diſcipline,</hi> well ſeene in the lawes and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Campe, and ſuch a one as knew well the vſe, benefit and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of all things belonging either vnto <hi>Food</hi> or
<hi>Raiment,</hi> he ſhould bee a louer of <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> impartiall in his dealings, and free from the tranſportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Paſſions:</hi> he ſhould haue an eare that contemptuouſly could beat backe, not furiouſly drinke in Slander and rayling language: hee ſhould haue an eye that could gaze on all obiects without winking, and an heart full of diſcreet compaſſion, but not toucht with fooliſh or melting pitie. In briefe, he ought to be only the Lawes ſeruant, and indeed to challenge no more in himſelfe, then ſo much as expreſt to her his obedience.</p>
               <p>For the nature of his Office, hee is firſt the great and principall <hi>Gaoler</hi> of the Armie, hauing power to detaine and keepe priſoner whoſoeuer ſhalbe committed vnto him by lawfull authoritie; and though ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly haue cal'd him the Hangman, or executioner of the Army, yet it is not ſo, but as our Sheriffes of Counties are bound to find ſlaues for ſuch needfull vſes: ſo he by his place is obliged to find men and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther implements for all ſuch occaſions, and to that end hath allowance for many attendants of all ſorts and conditions, and many Subſtitutes, which are called <hi>Vnder-Prouoſts,</hi> who haue likewiſe allowance of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants to diſpatch any execution how ſuddenly ſoeuer commanded, and to that end it is not lawfull for the <hi>Vnder-Prouoſts</hi> to goe at any time without Halters, Withs, or ſtrangling cords of Match, euer about them. The <hi>Pruoust-Marſhall</hi> hath the charge of all manner of
<hi>tortures,</hi> as <hi>Gyues, Shackels, Bolts, Chaines, Bilbowes, Manacles, Whips,</hi> and the like, and may by his Miniſters vſe them, either in caſe of Iudgement or Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from a <hi>Marſhall Court,</hi> or otherwiſe vpon vnrulineſſe at his owne diſcretion: hee is by his officers to ſee all places of Execution prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and furniſhed with Engins fitting to the Iudgement, whether it bee <hi>Gallowes, Gybbets, Scaffolds, Pillories, Stocks</hi> or <hi>Strappadoes,</hi> or any other Engine which is ſet vp for terrour and affright to ſuch as behold it.</p>
               <p>This Officer hath the guard and keeping of all ſuch Priſoners as are taken in the warres, till they be either ranſomed, exchanged, or by the <hi>General</hi> otherwiſe diſpoſed; &amp; in this caſe the nobler his vſage is, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will the praiſe be of his humanitie &amp; vertue. If any <hi>Drums</hi> or <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> ſhal happen to come from the enemy, they are by the <hi>Proueſt marſhall</hi> to be entertained, accommodated and prouided, vnleſſe it ſhall pleaſe the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14641:59"/>Lord <hi>Marſhall</hi> himſelfe otherwiſe to diſpoſe of them. And that all theſe duties before ſaid may with more efficacie and luſtre be performed, hee ſhall haue his Quarter in the ſtrongeſt and moſt ſecureſt part of all the Armie; and in all Marches he is alſo to haue the place of greateſt ſafetie, for the aſſurance of his Priſoners.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is the Office of the <hi>Prouost-Marſhall,</hi> by authoritie of the Lord <hi>Marſhal,</hi> to guard with a good Conuoy of men, both to the camp, in the camp, and from the camp, all maner of
<hi>Victualers, Vianders, Marchants</hi> and others which bring any prouiſions to the campe, and aſſoone as they are entred, he ſhall rate and ſet prize (in a reaſonable &amp; indifferent maner) vpon all their goods, and ſecures them from the inſolence of the Soldier, prouiding that no man take any thing from them without payment: hee alſo looks to the proportions of true Weights and Meaſures, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles any difference in buying and ſelling, for which labour he hath of the <hi>Prouidadors</hi> or
<hi>Marchants,</hi> the Hides and Tongues of all manner of cattell that are kill'd, and euery weeke ſixpence a piece in money num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred for their ſtalles, which ſixpence a weeke he is accountable for vnto the Lord
<hi>Marſhall,</hi> for to him that fee is belonging.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe the Office of the
<hi>Prouoſt-Marſhall,</hi> to ſee that the Market-place of the Campe bee once in two dayes ſwept and kept ſweet and cleane, that all garbage and filthineſſe bee burnt and conſumed, that no man doe the office of nature but in places conuenient, and that in the whole Campe or Garriſon there may not be any thing which may turne to a generall annoyance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prouost-Marſhall</hi> muſt haue an eſpeciall care to the keeping of the peace, and to apprehend the leaſt occaſion which may tend to the breach of the ſame, hee muſt preuent all Mutinies, Quarrels, and diſorders, and that no ſuch vnciuill diſſention may haue ſtrength to out-face or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the power of his command: hee ſhall euer haue attending about him a guard of his vnder <hi>Prouoſts</hi> and ſeruants, who with ſhort trunche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their hands, according vnto Military forme, ſhall enforce obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to any lawfull commandement which proceedeth from him, and hauing taken them in their actuall tranſgreſſions, to commit them to <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> or the <hi>Bolts,</hi> as the nature or euill example of the crime deſerueth; for it is a dutie expected at this Officers hands, to be a ready ſuppreſſor of all vice and diſorder, and to bee a maintenance and aduauncer of all thoſe which haue any ſemblance or likeneſſe with an honeſt, ſober and ciuill inclination; whence it behooueth him to haue a ready and quick iudging eye between the good and bad, ſo that he may in an early houre reſtraine all immoderat and vnlawfull Gaine, and rather compell the Cut-throat to kill himſelfe with enuy, then to conſume others with the ruſt and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of his vnſatisfied Couetouſneſſe. It is alſo a maine point in this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers dutie, to diſcouer the lurking ſubtilties of treacherous Spies, and by learning the true interpretation of mens <hi>Words, lookes, manners, formes,</hi> and
<hi>habits of apparell,</hi> to bee able to turne the inſide of their hearts out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and to pull out that little deuill of malicious deceit, though he lye
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14641:60"/>hid in neuer ſo darke a corner; and truly a better ſeruice cannot be done, nor is there any Art ſooner learned if a man will apply his knowledge but ſeriouſly thereunto.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the laſt dutie of the
<hi>Prouoſt-Maſhall,</hi> is (after the Watch is ſet at night) to ſuruey the Army, and ſee if it remaine calme and ſtill, and that no diſorderly noyſes or tumults keepe any part of it awake and not ſilent; and in this ſuruey, if he encounter with any immoderat fires, or ſuperfluous candle-lights, he ſhall cauſe them to be put out and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; or if he heare in Sutlers cabins or other harbors any
<hi>Drunkards, Tobacco takers,</hi> or other vnruly perſons, whoſe noiſe is both offenſiue to the Campe, and giueth to others an euill example, he ſhall preſently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them, and make them depart, or elſe vpon groſſer diſorder, commit them: for beſides the vndecency and vnfitneſſe of the action, ſuch cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and noiſes are more then hurtfull in a Campe, epecially being any thing neere where the
<hi>Sentinell</hi> ſtandeth: for it is an interruption and hindrance through which he cannot poſſibly diſcharge his dutie.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue briefly runne ouer all the maine points in which the duty of this Officer doth conſiſt, and though not with thoſe amplifications and inlargements, which might be required in a greater and more ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Volume (to which no law in this Art of writing will allow me) yet I know (like a reaſonable handſome picture) your Lordſhip may (if you pleaſe) iudge by it of euery feature in the liuing proportion, which if nobly you vouchſafe to doe, you pay mee the greateſt Intereſt my loue can wiſh, and I will ſtudie more and more to bee your ſeruant.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>ou are (my noble and worthy Lord) happie in your owne growing fruitfulneſſe to all goodneſſe, happy in your deſcent from your Parents noble vertues, and happy in the hopes of all that doe or ſhall depend vpon you, whence I make bold to ſend you this poore Epiſtle as an acknowledgment of my ſeruice, not to plead merit, but to ſignifie my wiſhes to the proſperitie of your Spring and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing beginning. If you pleaſe to reade it you ſhall finde nothing in it that is vncomely, if you neglect it, yet is it the figure of ſuch an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as wiſht it for your ſeruice; how euer I know your goodnes, and dare boldly knocke thereat, for I know it is a Gate that muſt not be ſhut againſt any honeſt or worthy endeauour.</p>
               <p>The Subiect whereof I intend to intreate in this Epiſtle, is of the <hi>Iudge-Marſhall,</hi> or as ſome call him (by the old Roman name) the <hi>Praetor,</hi> or Iudge in all Martiall cauſes. This is a renowned and reuerend Officer (as ſome ſuppoſe) attendant; but as I confidently imagine rather an aſſiſtant to the Lord <hi>Marſhall,</hi> for he is not alwaies deſigned, nominated, and appointed by the <hi>Generall</hi> or Lord <hi>Marſhall,</hi> but oftner by the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his Regall authoritie, which greatneſſe in election proues the dignitie and worthines of his place, for it is a rule in all the Titles of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> whatſoeuer, that as that is the greateſt, which riſeth immediatly from God and not from the King, ſo thoſe are the next beſt which riſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the King; and not by a ſecond from the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: but letting paſſe the curioſſity in his appointment, let it ſuffice vs that his place is of great Reuerence and reſpect, and the man which ought to be elected thereunto, ſhould be a perſon of ſincere and holy life, <hi>Learned, Religious,</hi> and of a ſound and approued knowledge in<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14641:61"/>matters of Iuſtice and Equitie, he ſhould haue a conſcience like an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and ſpotleſſe Virgin, delicate, quicke and tender, yet fit to receiue no impreſſion or ſtampe but that of goodnes, for he hath to doe with the bloods and liues of men, and no addulterate cenſure committed againſt them, but pulles with inceſſant cries vengeance from heauen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Author; I haue knowne (in mine owne experience) called to to this place both reuerend and famous
<hi>Diuines,</hi> and ſometimes learned and worthy <hi>Ciuilians,</hi> either of which haue diſcharged the place withall contentment and admiration, mannaging all their actions, both with a Religious feare of Gods Indgements, and a carefull duty to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of Iuſtice; but yet if a man had libertie to wiſh in this place the fulneſſe of perfection, me thinkes a man that had the mixture of both theſe excellent qualities were ſure of the beſt compoſition, and would farre exceede the ſingle Ingredian; that is to ſay, either <hi>Diuine Ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> or a <hi>Ciuill-Diuine</hi> would farre ſurpaſſe a ſmple <hi>Diuine</hi> or ſimple
<hi>Ciuilian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It cannot be denied but in as much as the <hi>Ciuill Law</hi> hath the greateſt ſway in all marſhall crimes &amp; controuerſies, therefore it is neceſſary the Iudge of theſe errors ſhould be learned in that profeſsion; ſo on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, ſince there is no conſtant path but it may walke whither ſoeuer the Conſcience pleaſe to giude it, there is a ſtrong neceſſity that Religion and Diuine knowledge come in for an aſsiſtance, leaſt by a ſmall miſtake the flatterd Conſcience may goe awry, and then there is no fall but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Precipice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Diuers I confeſſe haue written Military and Marſhall lawes, and of all thoſe not any with a more worthy or memorable approbation then our Reuerend and learned Doctor <hi>Sutolife,</hi> (whom I long knew in the wars and much reuerenced for his infinite vertues) being a man ſo able and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable through the merit of his owne rare experience that few comes neare, none equals him: yet he I know will modeſtly confeſſe that thoſe lawes cannot alwaies be certaine in all places; for <hi>Generalls</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues continually taking vpon them to make new lawes apteſt and fitteſt for the preſent Times, find ſometimes thoſe things which were ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined moſt fit, at other times to bee held the moſt inconuenient, and what was at one time moſt dangerous, at another time is moſt ſufferable and wholeſome; ſo that ſtill there muſt be a <hi>Quere</hi> left (as our Common Lawyers tearme it) and there is no conſtant Law (but the Iudges Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) for all manner of occaſions, maine Treſpaſſes only excepted, as <hi>Treaſons, Conſpiracies, Contempt of Officers, Cowardiſe, Theft,</hi> and the like: all which by ſetled rules are euermore moſt ſeuearely punniſhed: ſo that to a well mixed Law to haue a Iudge of a better mixed temper, is the beſt election that can bee found out by any noble and well tried Iudgement.</p>
               <p>Times in the Warres makes the nature of Offences differ, for I haue ſeene a man who for ſtealing of a Hat or ſuch a trifle, nay for going but out of his Quarter or breaking his array, hath beene kild or hang'd
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14641:61"/>vp Imediately, when at another time great fellonies haue beene commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but yet eſcaped, horrible offences pardoned, and groſſe Iniuries highly praiſed; this hath beene the working of Times and the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Iudge, neither will I ſtand in this place to argue either the one or the others greater goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Praetor</hi> or <hi>Iudge-Marſhall</hi> being thus choſen, his place and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is the ſame almoſt in effect and qualitie which they carry in our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Citties and Townes, whom we call by the names of <hi>Recorders,</hi> for as thoſe are the <hi>Mouthes, Iudgements</hi> and
<hi>Cenſures</hi> of the Supreame <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> which we call
<hi>Maior, Baily</hi> or <hi>Alderman,</hi> condemning or acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all ſuch as are brought before them for any criminall offence, of what nature or condition ſoeuer, becauſe it is ſuppoſed the higher Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is not learned in the Miſterie and Science of the Lawes: So is this
<hi>Praetor</hi> or <hi>Iudge-Marſhall</hi> the voice, Cenſure and opinion of the Lord <hi>Marſhall</hi> of the Armie, hauing full power and authority to drawe vp, Ingroſſe and pronounce all <hi>Sentences</hi> and
<hi>Proceſſes</hi> drawne &amp; agreed vpon in a <hi>Marſhall Court</hi> againſt any <hi>Delinquent</hi> or Capitall offender whatſoeuer; and for that cauſe he hath his ſeate and place in all Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall Courts next vnder the <hi>Lord-marſhall,</hi> where he ſitteth and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all complaints, euidences and proofes which are brought in againſt any criminall offendor; taking ample notes thereof and reducing them into heads both for his owne and all the other <hi>Captaines</hi> helpes which are Iudges in the ſame Court; which being heard at large and vpon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne oath; he then calleth in the offendor and againſt him layeth all the <hi>Inferences, Accuſations,</hi> and <hi>Imputations</hi> which had formerly beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, together with the proofes and aſſertions, receiuing the <hi>Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents</hi> ample and full anſwer to the ſame, with all thoſe teſtimonies and excuſes which he can produce: which done and the offending partie withdrawne, the
<hi>Praetor</hi> diſcourſeth to all the Court his opinion of all he hath heard, what agreeth with the lawes, and what ſtandeth againſt them, diſcuſsing all doubtfull queſtions, and truely and ſincearely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how far the nature of the Offence extendeth; of which, when his ſpeach is ended he craueth their Iudgement.</p>
               <p>Then the puny <hi>Captaine</hi> firſt, and ſo ſucceſsiuely all the reſt one after another giue their opinions of the nature of the offence, and what pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment it deſerueth; then in concluſion the <hi>Lord marſhall</hi> himſelfe (if he be preſent) giueth the finall ſentence; which finiſhed, the <hi>Praetor</hi> cauſeth the ſentence to be drawne, which being read by him to the whole Table, (to that effect which the <hi>Lord-marſhall</hi> pronounced) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the Priſoner is called for againe, vnto whome after the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> in a ſolemne and learned Oration hath ript vp the qualitie and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſnes of his ſinne and the excellencie of the Lawes in cutting off the crueltie of ſuch ſinnes, and then ſawdering vp the wounds of a torne and declacerat Conſcience with diuine and wholeſome counſell, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſhall reade vnto him the full tenor of his ſentence, in ſuch ſort as it is there written; and then deliuer it into the hands of the
<hi>Prouoſt-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:14641:62"/>to ſee it put in execution. And in this manner hee ſhall deale with all other controuerſies whatſoeuer; obſeruing ſtill to keepe in affaire and large Booke, handſomely ingroſt vp, all <hi>Complaints, Proceedings,</hi> and
<hi>Sentences</hi> whatſoeuer which ſhall paſſe before him, as well for his owne diſcharge, as the honor of the Court, and ſatisfaction of all ſuch as ſhall haue occaſion vpon any controuerſie or queſtion to ſearch or ouer-looke the ſame.</p>
               <p>And this is the greateſt part and effect of the
<hi>Iudge-Marſhalls</hi> Office in our Courts of warre, though in other Countries they haue further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; as the anſwering of forreigne Meſſengers, the drawing of Proclamations, controule of victuallers and the like; yet ſince for theſe we haue other perticular and diſtinct Officers, I will impoſe no more vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this then his due place challengeth, but only conclude thus. That if hee diſcharge his place rightly in manner and forme as it is diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, he ſhall queſtionleſſe doe to himſelfe a great honor, and performe a moſt acceptable worke both to God, the world, and all good Chriſtians.</p>

               <p>Concerning this Office of the <hi>Scout-master,</hi> or Captaine of the <hi>Vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currers,</hi> there haue been many variable diſputations touching his depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancie, nor is the reconcilement ſetled or made perfect in all mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, ſome fixing him vpon the Lord <hi>Marſhall,</hi> ſome on the <hi>Generall</hi> of the Horſe, and ſome on the <hi>Lieutenant Generall</hi> of the Horſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome on none, but as a publike Officer of great and eminent impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to ſubſiſt onely of himſelfe. True it is that the laſt opinion is moſt ſtrong, if we draw into conſideration the varietie and change of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for they are ſo many and ſo diuers, that indeed he cannot be ſayd to depend of any one, but of all, and may be truely called The <hi>Campes</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Seruant: yet if we come to particulars, and put thoſe many duties into ſeuerall Balances, we ſhall find that the weightieſt of all belongs to the Lord

               <p>Touching the election of this Officer, he ought to be a man of infinit great Valour and Iudgement, very skilfull in the knowledge of the Countrey wherein he ſerueth, a good <hi>Coſmographer,</hi> and deſcriber of the ſituations of places, and ſuch a one as by his eye can ſuddenly frame vnto himſelfe a Map of whatſoeuer he diſcouereth.

<hi>Diſcouering,</hi> is for the moſt part exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed when the Armie marcheth, at which time he is to receiue from the <hi>Lieutenant Generall</hi> of the Horſe (or ſome other by his appointment) a competent Guard or troupe of Horſemen, being for the moſt part all <hi>Light-horſemen</hi> or
<hi>Dragoones,</hi> and with theſe the <hi>Scout-maſter</hi> ſhall ride before the Armie, and ſcowre all the wayes and paſſages through which it ſhall march, and this he ſhall doe with all ſilence and ſwiftneſſe, taking ſtill into his conſideration the nature, eaſe, and dangers of all
<hi>Paſſages, Riuers,</hi> and <hi>Bridges:</hi> he ſhall gage and ſound the depths of all <hi>Foards,</hi> try their bredths, and how many may march ouer in breaſt, ſee whether the <hi>Shallow</hi> goe ouer ſtraight, and in a direct line or crooked, and whether the <hi>Channell</hi> be hard, muddie, or oppreſt with great ſtones, blocks, buſhes or the like, he ſhall likewiſe obſerue all <hi>Hils, Valleys, Straits, Woods, Bogs,</hi> and all aduantages or diſaduantages whatſoeuer: For howſoeuer it may be preſumed that the <hi>Generall,</hi> either by his friends, by the imployment of Spies, by Traytors or ſome other aduiſoes, nay by his own knowledge may haue ſome Notion or aſſurance of his paſſages, yet in reſpect of the preſent mutabilitie of times, and the ſtratagems of the enemy (which can neuer be idle in theſe buſie affayres:) this Officers can in no wiſe bee wanting; for by common experience we ſee, what was yeſterday; nay, within this houre paſſable, may at this inſtant be poſſeſſed by the enemy, or by his deuiſes impeached: <hi>Foards</hi> are ſoone choakt vp with <hi>Calthropes, Bridges</hi> are ſoone broken, conceal'd
<hi>Ditches</hi> eaſily caſt, <hi>Pitfals</hi> &amp; <hi>Mines</hi> in ſtrait wayes quickly dig'd, and an infinit world of other impediments to hinder an Armie; all which it is the Office of this <hi>Scout-master</hi> to diſcouer: yet with ſuch care and circumſpection, that ſtill hee be ſure to prouide for himſelfe and his company a good and a ſafe Retrait, for howſoeuer (in places of danger) he be not bound to ingage himſelfe ſo farre, that the enemy might cut betweene him and the Army, yet is hee not vpon a ſmall apprehenſion to cut his courſe ſo ſhort, as thereby the Armie might be toucht with the leaſt hazard. It is his part therefore to mount vp to the higheſt ground of aduantage, and where he may view the greateſt
<hi>Hemiſphere</hi> or <hi>Horyzon</hi> that is about him, and thence looke and obſerue the Countrey euery way, and if any difficultie of places be in his eye to diſcouer, hee ſhall ſend foorth certaine
<hi>Vant-curriers</hi> before<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14641:63"/>him, being men of knowledge, valor &amp; iudgment, who ſhall make plaine whatſoeuer to his eye remaineth doubtfull; and if in this ſeruice their valours ſhall tranſport them further then his directions, and ſo they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come engaged (which is a fault of an vnexcuſable nature) yet ſhall he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond them, and bring them off, if there be any poſſibilitie in the hazard. Nor ſhall he thus alone cleare the way which is directly before, but alſo hee ſhall ſend foorth his
<hi>Vantcurriers</hi> on euery ſide, and cleare the way round about him, &amp; what impediments ſoeuer he ſhal encounter withall; if out of his owne power he cannot relieue them, he ſhall immediatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and informe the
<hi>Lord-marſhall,</hi> and from him receiue either aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or ſome new directions.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Quarter-maſter</hi> ſhall attend the
<hi>Lord-marſhall</hi> about the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodgement and Quartering of the Armie, it in then the Office of the <hi>Scout-maſter</hi> to attend him alſo, and with his beſt Iudgement and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to take a ſerious and iudiciall ſuruey of the ground, and from the ſituation thereof to obſerue all aduantages and diſaduantages which may be either with, or againſt them, and with a modeſt freedome to deliuer his opinion, and the reaſons thereof vnto the <hi>Lord-marſhall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, when the <hi>Marſhals</hi> Trumpet ſhall ſet the Watch, inſtantly the <hi>Scout-maſter</hi> ſhal haue his Guard of Horſmen aſſigned vnto him either by the <hi>Generall</hi> or the
<hi>Licutenant-Generall</hi> of the Horſe. If there be not (as in moſt diſciplines there are) a certaine courſe or rule who continually ſhall guard him; and theſe being mounted, he leadeth without the camp, who watch and guard the ſame all that night, and are indeed truly thoſe whom we call
<hi>Sentinels Perdues;</hi> for there he placeth them in their ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places Sentinell-wiſe round about the Campe, giuing them ſtrickt charge vpon paine of death not to ſtirre vntill they bee relieued. As for the Marſhalling of them, it is according to his owne iudgement, or neere, or farre off, as time and the dangers require: for if the Campe be ſmall, and the number great, then hee placeth them thicker, and relieueth oftner; but if the Campe be wide, and the number ſmall, then they are thinner, and their duties longer. When the Watch is relieued, the <hi>Scout-maſter</hi> relieueth his <hi>Sentinels</hi> and <hi>Scouts,</hi> and the Campe not remouing he continueth his Ward for the day alſo, but in no wiſe after the ſame manner as hee did his Watch, but according to his diſcretion and iudgement hee ſhall alter his ground and place of Scouting: for hee ought to vnderſtand that all his endeauors are to diſcouer the enemy, but yet to keepe himſelfe cloſe and concealed, and therefore (as neere as he can) in watching he ſhall ſeeke to plant his Scouts in valleys and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending grounds, where their eyes may take the beſt proſpect betweene the light and the earth; but in the day time he ſhall make his Guard vpon the hils, whence his eyes may fetch the largeſt diſtance: In the ſeaſons which are tempeſtuous and bitter, then he ought to relieue often, but if calme and gentle, he may ſuit his troubles according. Aſſoone as the Army riſeth, it is his place to paſſe on before to the purpoſes already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed: and if he make no ſpeedy returne back againe, it argues a cleare
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14641:64"/>coaſt, yet muſt he not be too long abſent, but in ſome conuenient ſpace of time now and then preſent himſelfe to the Armie, leaſt they ſuſpecting his interception, might be drawne into ſome puzzle or amazement.</p>
               <p>This in effect is the whole ſubſtance of the
<hi>Scout-maſters</hi> Office, which though in ſome particular points it differ from the ancient Roman diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, who neuer at any time would vouchſafe to place loſt <hi>Sentinels</hi> neere the Campe, or deſperate
<hi>Scouts</hi> farre off, and remooued from the Campe: and notwithſtanding that <hi>Florus, Bellay,</hi> and many braue Hiſtorians doe wonderouſly approue of their diſallowance thereof, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning our diſcipline as ſomewhat too tyrannous therein, alleaging it either opens a way whereby the outward <hi>Sentinell</hi> may more eaſily bee corrupted, or the inward
<hi>Sentinell</hi> made a great deale more negligent and careleſſe, by relying their truſt on thoſe which are without; yet did not modeſty and good manners detaine me from arguing againſt ſo great, ſo ancient, and ſo well approued Maſters: doubtleſſe I could hold a ſtrong, a long, and almoſt an vnrefellable diſputation therein: but it ſhall ſuffice, my ſilence ſhall pleade me guiltie of yeelding vnto them, and I muſt and will euer confeſſe, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were great Souldiers, and accompliſht mightie and heroicall Actions, yet with this Proteſtation I will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly conclude mine Epiſtle, That at this day the Art and Diſcipline of Warre is as abſolute and perfect amongſt vs, as euer it was amongſt the old <hi>Romans.</hi>

               <p>This Office and Officer (of whoſe nature I am to diſcourſe to your Lordſhip) we call the <hi>Liuetenant</hi> of the <hi>Ordnance</hi> or vnder Captaine of the <hi>Artillery,</hi> and is indeede no leſſe then the Subſtitute, or immediate next in command and authority to the <hi>Maſter of the Ordnance</hi> or <hi>Great Captaine of the Artillerie:</hi> a man which for his ellection ought to haue many ſinguler good parts, as <hi>Learning, Wiſdome, Valour, Temperance</hi> and all the ſpacious degrees of an honeſt and worthy frugalitie. He ought to be a Souldier from his Cradle, for he can haue no experience to old, nor indeed is there any experience either young or old which (once in his<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14641:65"/>life) will not come within the compaſſe of his neceſſity; he had neede be more then a

               <p>The Office of the <hi>Ordnance</hi> is of that great and ſinguler importance that few in the armie exceede it, and indeede ſo weighty as with great difficulty any one man is able to paſſe through and fully to diſcharge it: whence it comes that there are allowed vnto him many aſsiſtants, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally one aboue the reſt; who being next to himſelfe, we call by the name of his <hi>Liuetenant,</hi> and in truth whatſoeuer may belong to the care of the Maſter, all that is euer within the compaſſe of his authority alſo; for not only in his abſence doth he carry the generall care of all proceedings within that perticular affaire, but alſo in his preſence hath a particuler reference to the ordering of many duties which as burthens too groſe and heauie, are remoued from the
<hi>Master</hi> to the <hi>Liuetenants</hi> ſhoulders: and therefore it is requiſite that whereſoeuer the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Ordnance</hi> is abſent, there the <hi>Liuetenant</hi> be euer preſent, as if the Maſter be in the Campe, then muſt the <hi>Liuetenant</hi> bee at the Breach or Curtaine, if thee Maſter bee at the Breach, then the <hi>Liuetenant</hi> at the <hi>Store-houſe,</hi> the <hi>mine</hi> or ſome other place of neceſſarie Imploiment, and indeed the Offices doe ſo neceſſarily depend one vpon another, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this mans duty can hardly bee deſerned, till with the other (which is the greater) it bee arteficially compared, and therefore in the Office of the Maſter of the <hi>Ordnance,</hi> this Office of the <hi>Liuetenant</hi> ſhall be made more plaine and eaſie. But to proceede, this Officer hath vnder him many Inferior Officers, as Maſter-Gunners, Canoniers, Waggon-maſter, the Furrier and diuerſe Clerkes, beſides Gun-makers, and Carriage makers, and others of meaner dependance; ſo that he is as a middle man betweene the Maſter of the
<hi>Ordnance</hi> and his Inferior Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, giuing an account to one, and taking account from others, and by reaſon of his more generall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mercement with thoſe men (who haue their only dependance on him, and finde all their neceſſities relieued by him) he hath a more liberall and free power both to heare from them, and ſee in them many negligences and eſcapes which the Maſter can in no wiſe behold, and which, it is his duty and place to ſee reformed, either by his owne power, or by complaint to the Maſter, who is not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute or craue Teſtimonie in any thing which the <hi>Liuetenant</hi> ſhall declare vnto him.</p>
               <p>It is the Office of this <hi>Liuetenant</hi> to ſee that both the Maſter Gunner and all his vnder Gunners doe their duties in obſeruing and mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Peeces, in mounting, diſmounting, in their diligence in charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſcharging; lading, leueling and whatſoeuer elſe belongs to their art and cunning, and to the end that his eie may bee of more force, both in the finding out and mending of all errors which ſhall
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14641:65"/>come within the compaſſe of his knowledge; it is very conuenient that he himſelfe be skilfull and expert in the ſame knowledge, ſo as vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery error or fault diſcerned, he may bee able not only to correct and controule, but alſo to inſtruct and teach the Ignorant how and in what manner to amend any eſcape in what ſort ſoeuer committed.</p>
               <p>It is his eſpeciall duty to ſee that his Store-houſe or place of change be continually furniſhed withall manner of prouiſions both for Artile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Muniſion and all ſorts of Armes, both offenſiue and defenſiue; as Ordnance ready mounted with all their cooplements, Ornaments, Tires, and neceſſaries which belong vnto the ſame, as Cannons for Batterie, from the leaſt to the greateſt ſize; as from ſixe to tenne inches in board or height, and carrying bullet from forty foure to ſeauenty pound weight; demie-Cannons which carry bullet from twenty foure to thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie pound weight; Culluerins from ſixteene to twenty pound, Demie-Culluerines, Faulcons, Faulconets and Sakers; Quintalls of Cannon-powder and other powder, and Oxe hides to couer and defend the ſame; Shot of Iron, Leade, and ſtone in great quantitie and for all manner of Peeces, Match in great abundance, Iron ſhouells, Mattocks, Pickaxes, Axes, Hatchets, Hookes, Planks, Boards, Maunds, Baskets, Nailes for Tyers, and all other purpoſes, Sawes Sledges, Iron barres, Crowes, Augers, Engines for all purpoſes; Chargers, Ladles, Rammers, Spunges, Chaines, Cart-clouts, Weights, all ſorts of Smiths tooles, Horſe-ſhoos and Nailes, Cordage, Coffers, Candles, Lanthorns, Ceare-cloathes, Soape, Tarre, ſoft Greaſe, Scalling ladders, beſide a world of other things which are needleſſe to reſite and yet depend on the Ordnance; He ſhall haue alſo in ſtore all manner of ſmall ſhott as Muſquets, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goones, Piſtolls and the like; with all manner of Implements belonging vnto them either for Horſe or Foote; alſo all ſorts of
<hi>Launces, Pikes, Murrions, Corſlets, Swords, Daggers, Girdles, Hangers, Bandeleers, Bullet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bagges, Flaskes</hi> and <hi>Touch-boxes</hi> for Horſemen, <hi>Carbines</hi> or <hi>Petronells,</hi> and indeede generally all manner of Armes whatſoeuer; for it were an infinite thing in this ſhort Epiſtle to reckon vp all which appertaines to this great Office: Now as this Store houſe is to bee furniſhed with all theſe ſeuerall prouiſions, ſo likewiſe it is to be accomodated with men of all the ſeuerall Trades belonging to ſuch prouiſions as Mine-maſters, Smiths, Founders, Coopers, Carpenters, Wheele-wrights and the like; all which as they are vnder the Guard of the <hi>Liuetenant</hi> of the <hi>Ordnance,</hi> ſo it is his Office to ſee them prouided of all maner of neceſſaries belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Trades, which by vertue of his warrants or potents hee ſhall raiſe from any man that is owner thereof (being a friend) at ſuch Rates and Prizes as by the Maſter of the <hi>Ordnance</hi> ſhall be appointed, and alſo he ſhall call vpon the pay-Maſter of the Artillery (if any defect ſhall bee in that behalfe) for the true payment of all wages to all theſe or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which are vnder his commandment, and if the defect bee in the Treaſurer, he ſhall then enforme the Maſter of the <hi>Ordnance</hi> and from him receiue order for the redreſſe of the ſame, and then hee ſhall alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſee
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14641:66"/>that the Clerke of the <hi>Ordnance</hi> doe truely and faithfully keepe an account both of the paies and all other charges belonging to the Office by <hi>Libranzas,</hi> or Tickets ſent either from the Maſter of the <hi>Ordnance</hi> himſelfe, or elſe from his <hi>Liuetenant;</hi> and laſtly he ſhall ſee that the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior</hi> generall (which ſome call the <hi>Committie</hi> of the <hi>Ordnance</hi>) doe make al his prouiſions (whether it be of Baſtiments or other neceſſaries depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either vpon the Office, or the people appeteining vnto the Office) in a good and ſufficient manner, without either Crueltie or remiſneſſe; neither offending the Friend from whom he raiſeth theſe profits by any vniuſt and vnlawfull exactions, nor yet wronging the place by want of ſuch neceſſary commodities, either through his ſlacknes in duty, Bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or any other ſoft-hearted or pratiall forbearance.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Epiſtle (becauſe I ſhall haue ocaſion to amplifie it a great deale more in the office of the Maſter of the
<hi>Ordnance</hi>) it is the Office of the <hi>Liuetenant</hi> of the
<hi>Ordnance</hi> to deliuer vnto euery Captaine or his Officer whom he ſhall appoint for that purpoſe (vpon Iuſt and approued defects, or vpon warrant from the Maſter of the <hi>Ordnance;</hi> all manner of ſupplies of Armes and Munition whatſoeuer, whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Pike, Muſquet or any other weapon whatſoeuer as alſo Powder, Match, Bullet or Lead, (according to the nature of his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) and the ſame ſo deliuered ſhal defalke out of the Captaines Count, &amp; reckoning by the returne of his certificate into the hands of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, vnder Treaſurer or their deputies. Many other things depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Office, but theſe are the moſt materiall, and from them (by an eaſie expoſition) may be reduced all the reſt, ſo that I may very well caſt Anchor here and reſt till by the courſe of Time and my purpoſe in theſe proceedings I be inforced to ſaile into a much larger <hi>Ocean.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know (my Lord) that to expreſſe you as you are in the true dignitie of your place, were to ſet you farre before the firſt in this great Range: for as you are the Sonne of an Earle, ſo you ſtand vpon an higher Scale, and by the curteſie of our Land, moue where you may behold theſe moue below you. But when I conſider how I haue formerly made bold with a noble Peere of your owne Ranke (I meane the Heire of the Noble houſe of <hi>Worcester</hi>) and finde that as you are Earles ſonnes, and ſo walke before in Curteſie, ſo you are Barons, and by that true right ſit in the Vpper Houſe of Parliament (which other Earles ſonnes cannot doe) I could not but conceiue that this ſmaller lampe gaue the clearer light, and that by placing you in this Range, I darkened not, but did much rather adde to your ſplendor, by ſhewing that as you may march amongſt the ſonnes of Earles, in caſe of Triumph, ſo you may ſit amongſt the Peeres of the land in matter of Iuſtice. It is farre from me to dreame of any abatement in your Greatneſſe; for ſo farre haue I been bound to the noble goodneſſe of your thriſe worthy Father, that I muſt proteſt from the plaine truth of an vnſpotted affection, if I were able to adde or bring one ſparke of glory to the Altar of your great Name, I would doe it with all fulneſſe, all ſwiftneſſe, though the malice of the whole world as a greedy torrent lay ready to ouerwhelme me.</p>
               <p>But to proceed to the diſcourſe at which mine occaſion now pointeth; It is the Office of the <hi>Muster-maſter,</hi> of which there are two kinds, the one in Warre, the other in Peace; and howſoeuer they agree in name, yet in nature they haue little coherence: but ſince it is of the firſt (as namely the <hi>Muſter-maſter</hi> in Warre) vpon whom now I muſt diſcourſe:<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14641:67"/>I will omit all circumſtance and diſputation, and plainly fal to the diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his Office.</p>
               <p>Firſt, touching the nature of the perſon himſelſe, it is certaine, that (for the moſt part) <hi>Muſter-maſters</hi> in the warres are very odious vnto Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines; for in ſeruing of his Prince truly, and in muſtering ſtricktly he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth much vndue profit from the Captaine, and ſpoyleth him of thoſe payes, which it may be he had hop'd ſhould haue relieued many of his neceſſities: on the other ſide, if the
<hi>Muſter-maſter</hi> doe conniue &amp; blance at faults either for affection, or profit, then muſt he neceſſarily be an euill ſeruant to the State, and the end of all his worke can be nothing but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and reprehenſion: ſo that I conclude, it is the honeſt
<hi>Muſter-maſter</hi> and the honeſt Captaine which muſt agree and liue in a wholeſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord together; the Captaine being carefull (as neere as in him lies) to keepe his Company ſtrong and according to couenant; and the Muſter-maſter abiding a conſiderat man, free from corruption, neither ſtanding too punctually on ſmall trifles, nor yet ſo wilfully blind as not to ſee er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors that are groſſe and palpable; let vprightnes therefore be done on all ſides (for to diſcourſe of Iniuries might inſtruct or open a way vnto In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury) ſo ſhall the Prince be well ſerued, the Captaine better payed, and the Muſter-maſter beſt of all reputed.</p>
               <p>Touching the election of a <hi>Muſter-master</hi> for the warres, he would be a man of good reckning and account, a man honeſt, diſcreet, vpright, and one that feareth God: he ſhould be an able man both in Perſon, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Subſtance, and indeed ought to ſee all equitie and Iuſtice per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed between the Prince, the Captaine, and the Souldier; he ought to haue the two beſt parts of a Gentleman, Valour, and Temperance, for howſoeuer there haue bin a falſe poſition held a mongſt Souldiers, that
<hi>Muster-maſters</hi> muſt be Pen-men, and not men of the Sword, yet there is errour in the conceit, for I haue in mine owne experience knowne Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Muſter-maſters equally to exchange and alter their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Muſter-maſters becomming Captaines, and Captaines Muſter-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and indeed not without great reaſon; for beleeue it, this place euer deſerueth a full Captaines experience. Againe, whereas in the old &amp; leſſe orderly times it was not lawfull for the Muſter-maſter to take Muſters without the preſence of the Treaſurer, the rude Soldier taking vpon him an ill libertie to bend his Pike vpon him vnleſſe hee came vnder that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; yet it is now otherwiſe, and the Muſter-maſter may take his view or muſters of the Souldiers when he pleaſe, where he pleaſe, and in what maner he pleaſe, prouided it be done with an honeſt vprightnes, without any enuious crueltie againſt the Captaine, or by withdrawing from the Souldier his full meanes and due reckoning.</p>
               <p>As concerning the principall parts of his office and dutie, they conſiſt chiefly in the taking of Muſters, that is to ſay, in the taking of a full and perfect view of all the ſeuerall Souldiers of euery Band and Troupe, as well the officers from the firſt to the loweſt, as the others which are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, collecting into a Booke the names and ſurnames of euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14641:67"/>their ages, haires, complexions, and other eſpeciall markes as alſo their Armes and Weapons of euerie ſeuerall kinde; their Horſes, Furnitures, and other eſpeciall markes to them belonging, with whatſoeuer elſe may auaile and helpe his knowledge heereafter when hee ſhall haue a cauſe to take a reuiew of the ſame. And that this may be done more effectually, and for the diſcharge of thoſe greater of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers (as our Lord <hi>Lieutenants</hi> or their deputies) by whom armies are firſt raiſed; euery Captaine (at his arriuall at the maine Rendiuous) ſhall (when hee bringeth his Souldiers before the <hi>Muſter master</hi> to bee firſt viewed and receiued into pay) deliuer to the
<hi>Muſter-master</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture which paſſed betweene him and the Lord <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> or his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie, at whoſe hands he receiued his men, and by that, the Muſter-maſter ſhall call &amp; view euery man and his ſeuerall Armes particularly by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which found iuſt and according to the Indenture and the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Generall, preſently the <hi>Muſter-maſter</hi> ſhall giue vnto the Captaine a <hi>Warrant of Entery</hi> containing the Captaines and his officers names, together with the full number of Souldiers as they are allowed in liſt, with their ſeuerall payes and entertainments, &amp; the day from whence ſuch pay ſhall enure or begin, which Warrant ſigned vnder the <hi>Muster-masters</hi> hand and ſeale, the Captaine ſhall deliuer to the Treaſurer or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Treaſurer, and from thenceforth receiue his pay accordingly.</p>
               <p>The ſecond taking of Muſters, is when the Souldiers are to depart into the field, or goe vpon any preſent or great ſeruice, at which time the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-maſter ſhall (by a Booke receiued from the Captaine or his Clarke, and compared with his owne firſt Booke) take a view of all the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Armes, &amp; finding them ſtrong and ſufficient giue them (by a bill vnder his hand) full allowance for their meanes as was before ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Now the third taking of Muſters is after ſeruice performed, or when there is ſuppoſed to be any loſſe or decay in the Army; and this Muſter he ſhall take by the firſt &amp; ſecond booke ioyntly compared together and recording downe all ſuch as ſhalbe loſt either by the Sword, by ſickneſſe, or by any other caſualtie; alſo to take ſpeciall notice of the exchange or alteration of any Soldier, or when any new man is entred, that an honeſt and true account may be kept betweene him, the Captaine and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier for full count and reckoning, and in this muſter (or any other) if hee ſhall find the company not to be full or in ſtrength according to the liſt, then ſhall he defalke and make checke vpon the ſame; and in his certificat vnto the Treaſurer ſhall ſet downe the true and full number which ſhall be paid, and no more.</p>
               <p>As thus at theſe three eſpeciall times he ſhal take theſe ſeuerall viewes, ſo ſhall he alſo doe at any other time when the Generall ſhall appoint, or vpon the ſuit of any Captaine (who hauing bene checkt and hath againe made vp his Company ſtrong as before) deſireth to haue it againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiewed, that he may receiue certificat for his full entertainment. And in this taking of Muſters or viewes, it is a great caution which euery Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-maſter ought to obſerue, that by all meanes as hee makes ſeuerall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14641:68"/>of names and Armes, ſo he muſt alſo diſtinguiſh nations &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not ſuffer the French to paſſe vnder the name of Engliſh, nor I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian vnder the Dutch; for it is a matter of great conſequence, &amp; ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſht mixtures haue bred many confuſſions in the greateſt armies, and therefore after the firſt warning they are to be checkt and puniſht ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely. If the Army liue vpon lendings, then at euery ſix moneths end there is a count and reckoning to be had betweene the Prince and euery Souldier which hath ſuruiued and liued in the armie the full ſpace of ſix moneths and vpward, as thus for example: the ful pay of euery common Soldier is eight pence <hi>per diem,</hi> which amounteth to foure ſhillings eight pence the week: ſo that hauing but three ſhillings a week lendings, there remaineth twentie pence a weeke to reckon for at the ſixe moneths end, which commeth to betwixt forty ſhillings or ſeuen nobles a man, which commonly is paid in prouant apparell. It therefore appertaineth to the Muſter-maſter by comparing his ſeuerall Books together, and noting the deaths and exchanges of men, to make out his certificat to the Prouant-maſters or Treaſurer, what apparell or money ſhal be deliuered to euery Captaine. This dutie I haue knowne performed by an officer called the Controller of Muſters, which becauſe it ſtands vpon no old foundation, but by him that euilly found it out, was as euilly put in execution, I would be loath therefore either to giue it allowance or preſident. And therfore to conclude this Epiſtle, it is to be vnderſtood, that for as much as armies are large, and extend into many parts, ſo as it is impoſſible for any one man to exerciſe all theſe duties in his owne perſon, and in euery place; therefore euery Muſter-maſter hath allowed vnder him diuers Deputies or Subſtitues, which are called the
<hi>Commiſaries</hi> of Muſters, who haue the full powers of Muſter-maſters, and may performe all things in ſuch ſort as hath been formerly declared, and haue for the ſame competent allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, beſides commonly the dead pay of one priuat Souldier from eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Captaine that is within his Muſter. Little more then what I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared doth depend vpon this Officer, and all that is ſaid if hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge with an vpright and vnpartiall conſcience, I dare be bold to affirme before your Lordſhip, that a better member (of his ranke and place) is hardly to be found in the Armie.</p>

               <p>The Office (my Lord) of a <hi>Quarter-Maſter-Generall</hi> in an Armie is of no ſmall Importance, but ought to carry Greatnes in himſelfe, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his place and greatneſſe in the leaſt ſhadow of his ſmaleſt duty, and howſoeuer he hath much correſpondence and as it were adhering<pb n="126" facs="tcp:14641:69"/>to a kind of dependance vpon the Lord Marſhall and the <hi>Serieant Maior-Generall</hi> of the Field; yet is he of an abſolute and powerfull authority, and howſoeuer he receiue from them matter whereupon to worke, yet are the duties of his place abſoſute in himſelfe and rather ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to aduice and aſſiſtance then to any controlement.</p>
               <p>He ought in his ellection to be a man of great reſpect and reuerence in the Armie, full of ſound knowledge in Marſhall Diſcipline, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well read in diuers of the liberall Sciences, eſpecially,

               <p>The firſt maine part of his duty is (when the Lord-Marſhall goeth forth to make ellection of the ground whereon to encampe the Armie) to ſummon together all the Inferior Quarter-Maſters belonging to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſeuerall Regiment, and thoſe Quarter-Maſters to call together euery

Againe, if the Armie be compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of many ſeuerall Nations, it is the care and duty of the Quarter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Generall to quarter euery Nation by it ſelfe, and to deale ſo equally and indifferently betweene one nation and another, ſuiting their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations with ſuch an euen and well proportioned hand, that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or diſlike may be taken of any part, but all men receiuing their Indifferent content, there may ariſe no cauſe of Muteny or Emulation; which euer is moſt apteſt to ſpring from theſe or the like grounds, as I could recite a world of Inſtances would either leaſure or the limits of my paper allow it.</p>
               <p>It is true that all grounds doe not giue equall ſtrength, and therefore aſſoone as the Lord <hi>Marſhall</hi> hath appointed out the moſt commodious place whereon to fixe the Campe, it is then the Quarter-maſter-Generals duty to ſhare and deuide it into the ſeuerall perticulars as hath beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed, and in thoſe deuiſions he ſhall (as nere as conueniently hee can) deuide all thoſe naturall ſtrengths in ſuch wiſe that euery Supreame Offcer may participate ſomething thereof, and what is wanting in the worke of nature, to leaue it to be ſupplied by art through the diligence of the Trench-maſter or Engne-maſter to whoſe charge it aperteineth</p>
               <p>Now for the generall Marſhalling or Quartering of a Campe; that I may giue a little taſte or eſſay thereof, it is to be vndreſtood that in the Center or mid point of the Campe ſhall bee firſt lodged the Generalls Sanderd, and nere vnto it his Pauilion; from whence ſhall bee deriued two maine great ſtreets each croſſing the other, then vpon one ſide of<pb n="128" facs="tcp:14641:70"/>the Generall ſhall be quartered the Lord

<hi>Marſhall</hi> the Liuetenant Generall of the Foote, and behind the Munition the Maſter of the <hi>Ordnance</hi> and the <hi>Serieant Maior</hi> of the Horſe and Foote, according to their Ranke and antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Commandments; behind them the Victuallers, Butchers Cookes, Bakers and the like; behind them carriage horſes, draught Oxen and Cattell for the Campe, and behind them the Waggons, Waggoners, Carters, Laborers and Pioners, and in a Quarter oppoſite againſt them the Gunners and Officers of the
<hi>Ordnance,</hi> all the Carpenters, Wheele-wrights, Smiths and Labourers: and in another quarter oppoſite to them are quartered all the Armorers, Cutlers and other Tradeſmen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Store, as alſo Tailors, Shoomakers and the like; then laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the outmoſt verge or outer Ring of the Campe, (yet within the fortification) is (as a guard) placed all the great <hi>Ordnance,</hi> vpon a <hi>Vaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure</hi> of earth arteficially caſt vp before them; then the general Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Campe ſhall be about threeſcore or foureſcore paces without the <hi>Ordnance,</hi> which ſhall not be drawne into any euen line, but into as many angles as may be. And thus your Lordſhip hath a briefe <hi>Fac ſimile</hi> of the

It is true, that theſe Pioners are a confuſed maſſe of labouring people, brought vp only to digge and delue the earth, without any ciuill nourture, or indeed decent humanitie, and therefore are not reckoned
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14641:71"/>Souldiers, neither come neere by many degrees either to that liſt or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but are ſo farre contrary to all things which haue any ſhew of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that it is one amongſt the puniſhments of criminals, when any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldier ſhall commit a ſleight offence, ſauouring either of careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſlouthfulnes, or baſenes, then preſently to take away his Sword, and make him a Pioner, which in times paſt I haue knowen ſo hatefull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable to euery quick and vnderſtanding ſpirit, that they would with more alacrity haue run to the Racke, the Bolts or Strappado, nay euen to death it ſelfe rather then to this mortall (as they ſuppoſed it) degradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſuch contempt was the poore Pioner in, and ſo diſgracefull appeard that change to the Souldier; yet queſtionleſſe this I muſt affirme, that at all approches, mounts, trenches, and vnderminings, the poore Pioner is in as great danger, as often ſlaine, and both comes on vpon his worke, and goes off from his worke with as doubtfull and as great hazards as any man in the Army of what place or ranke ſoeuer; only it is the bare opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (without ground) which makes it vile, &amp; the meanneſſe of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: for the ſeruice it ſelfe is both noble and neceſſary, nor can an Army be or ſubſiſt without them. And hence it hath come to paſſe that in theſe our latter warres (eſpecially in the Low countries, and vnder the commaund of the moſt excellent Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>) to take away this ill grounded opinion of the baſeneſſe of Pioners, and to ſaue an infinit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of expence (which otherwiſe muſt haue been disburſt vpon theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular prouiſions) they haue cauſed all their common ſouldiers in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to turne Pioners, making them weare both Swords &amp; Spades, which queſtionles at firſt they drew on by gentle, politike, and ſmooth degrees, as in ſome great caſe of neceſſitie, where preſent aſſurance would allow no ſtay, but that all men muſt be imployed: and to this doubtleſſe ſome great Commaunder (with his owne hand) gaue the firſt example; or elſe they were inticed by the promiſe of ſome extraordinary allowance (as what is it with which profit will not make moſt men diſpence) ſo that in the end finding many of theſe oceaſions, and faining ſome, at laſt it grew to a cuſtome, and what at firſt with ſome difficultie they entreated, now they began boldly to commaund; ſo that collecting the infinite charge which was ſaued, and the great expedition and alſo exactnes with which their workes are performed, they began to make it penall in any man which ſhould refuſe this (late but deſpiſed) vndertakings. To which ſome of our Engliſh Commanders, more willing (for their owne ends) to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Dutch, then to prouide for their owne Countrey-mens eaſe and ſafety, gaue ſo farre way, that now it is a thing vtterly vnrecouerable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; for mine owne part I doe know, and muſt euer acknowledge that it is the dutie of euery braue and generous Spirit (in caſes of great neceſſitie) to imagine that no danger, toyle or baſenes can be too much, where either the glory of God, the ſeruice of his Prince, or the ſafetie of his Countrie is ingaged: but in all occaſions, and at all times to make the well-deſeruing Souldier an ordinary packe-horſe, I cannot but thinke the diſcipline too ſtrickt, and that it doth as it were giue a wound of diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14641:71"/>to euery generous breaſt, making the ſweet delight of the wars turne irkeſome and vnpleaſing.

               <p>Now for the eſpeciall dutie of the <hi>Captaine Generall</hi> of this Regiment, he is firſt to looke to the keeping of them in good order, concord and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, to ſee that they haue their pay and intertainment (according to their rates) in as due and fit manner as any other common Souldiers; that they keepe ſafely, and make not away any of the tooles or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherewith they are armed, and that they be continually in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vpon euery call for any imployment.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Lord-Marſhall,</hi> the <hi>Serieant-Maior,</hi> or the <hi>Trench-Master</hi> ſhall draw the platforme of any Trench, whether it be for the fortification of the Campe, or for the aſſailing of any beſieged Towne, whether it be to bring men to the aſſault, or elſe to throw vp and countermine any worke of the enemies, preſently vpon the firſt ſummons giuen to the Captaine of the <hi>Pioners,</hi> he ſhal raiſe ſo many of his men as ſhall be commanded by the Lord <hi>Marſhall</hi> or other ſuperiour Officer, and with them (armed with all tooles conuenient for the ſeruice) ſhall march to the head or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Trench, and hauing receiued directions, together with the forme and figure of the worke which is to be made, hee ſhall foorthwith take a ſpade, and himſelfe dig vp the firſt turfe, and then all the <hi>Pioners</hi> by that example ſhall inſtantly fall to their labor, and dig the Trench accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to directions, during which time he ſhall be euer with them, giuing them all maner of incouragement, and prouiding that euery man do his dutie without ſlacknes, neglect, or any ſlouthfull action: If he find that the labor be ſore and difficult, he ſhall then at his diſcretion relieue them, by bringing new ſupplies, and ſending away thoſe that are ouerwearied, that they may be againe refreſhed; and thus he ſhal without ceaſing cauſe the worke to be continued, till euery thing be finiſhed according to the will of the ſuperiour Commander. And in this worke is to be obſerued, that if it be to be done in the face of the enemy, and where their ſhot may freely play vpon them, that then ere the <hi>Pioners</hi> begin to dig, they ſhall plant barrels and great veſſels fil'd with earth and plac't in double rowes before them, vnder whoſe guard, or the guard of ſome other wall, hill, mount or gabion they ſhal begin to dig, til they haue couered themſelues in the earth, &amp; then they are paſt perill, and may proceed to work at their pleaſures; and whenſoeuer they either come from their work, or go vnto their worke, ſtill their Colours muſt flie before them; for the Captaine of
<hi>Pioners</hi> is as capable of Colours as any other Captaine whatſoeuer, and may beare them mixt with the Enſigne of the kingdome in what maner
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:14641:72"/>himſelfe pleaſeth. As thus he bringeth them to the digging of Trenches &amp; Mines, ſo alſo it is his dutie to bring them to the making of Bulwarks or Mounts placed vpon Angles, ſome lading &amp; carying the earth in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, baskets, and wheele-barrows, by which are framed the <hi>Traueſſes</hi> or flankers of the Bulwarke, the <hi>Orechion</hi> which is the guard or ſhoulder of the Bulwark, the <hi>Curtaine</hi> which is the Front, the <hi>Counterfront,</hi> which are the Spurrs, the
<hi>Pestils</hi> or Parapets, the entrance in &amp; out, and the place for the Artillery, ſome ramming, ſome knocking in piles to faſten the earth, and ſome cutting vp turfe &amp; ſods with which to aſſure the groundwork; and as in theſe, ſo in all other matters of Fortifications, theſe
<hi>Pioners</hi> are of very neceſſary vſe, and the Captain ſhalbe ſure to haue them euer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vpon any moment of warning, as either when any new workes are to be framed, or any old repaired: for albe theſe Fortifications of earth are better reſiſters of the Cannon then thoſe of ſtone worke, and both make leſſe ruines and alſo are leſſe aſſailable, yet they are but of ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and will quickly decay by reaſon of the looſeneſſe of the mould, if they be not continually viſited with carefull eyes, and preſently mended by artificiall &amp; good workmen. To conclude, it is the office of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the
<hi>Pioners</hi> to ſee his Regiment euer quartered as neere vnto the munition as is poſſible, both becauſe they are properly appertaining thereunto (being the men to carry and recarry, to load and vnload the ſame) as alſo becauſe all the neceſſary tooles and Engines wherwith they worke, and which they muſt daily alter according to the alteration of their labors, are ſtored and preſerued in the ſame.</p>
               <p>This is the ſubſtance and effect of this office, the which howſoeuer a greater knowledge may cloath in a great number of more wordes, yet I dare aſſure your Lordſhip, they will ſtill but arriue at the ſame end, and though the Garment may bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better to looke on, yet it will be little more eaſie, more in faſhion, or longer laſting.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very one (my Lord) is ſo great a louer of his owne deſignes, that he is eaſie to be flatterd with any hope that can lend beauty to the ſame, yet I hope it ſhall not ſo fare with me in this Epiſtle, for ſince you haue with all felicitie linckt in Marriage with that ſweeteſt Goodneſſe, to whoſe Noble Father I ſtand bound for almoſt all the ſtrengths of my preſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, I doubt not but my hopes will conuert to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances in your fauour, and howſoeuer this Epiſtle challenge your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention for at leaſt a couple of minuts, yet in as much as it ſhall bring you a plaine tale from an honeſt breaſt, and a willing ſeruice from a faithfull heart, I feare not but you will vouchſafe to accept it. Beleeue it (ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nord Sir) there is no flattery in it, for neither are you a ſubiect on whom I durſt vent ſuch follie, nor haue I a ſoule (I hope) guilty of ſo baſe a condition.</p>
               <p>A Captaine of Foote or of the Infantrie, is the higheſt of all priuate Commanders and yet the loweſt of all that command in cheife, and howſoeuer there is abilitie in a Captaine to create Inferior Officers; yet cannot a Captaine by any meanes make a Captaine, but he is euermore deriued from the King himſelfe, or from his eſpeciall authority granted to
<hi>Generalls</hi> of Armies. The Lords of his Priuie counſell, the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of Garriſons, Viceroyes or Preſidents of Countryes, or elſe to the Lords <hi>Liuetenants</hi> of perticular Shiers: ſo that hence we may collect,<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14641:73"/>that none but men of true merit ought to aſpire to theſe places of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne and Honor; but there are three maine Torrents (as namely <hi>Fraud, Flatterie</hi> and <hi>Bribes</hi>) which oftentimes blowes the Bias of this Bowle the contrary way.</p>
               <p>To ſpeake then briefely what a Captaine of Foote ſhould be, (not what he is) they ought firſt for their ellection to be Gentlemen both of Blood and Qualitie, who hauing <hi>Haniball</hi>-like beene trained vp in the warres euen from their Infancie, and paſſing through all the Inferior places of Command, Anchor now with good opinion at that of the
<hi>Liuetenant;</hi> whence for his experience he is worthy to bee aduanc't to a Captaine, (for it is an heartbreake to an expert Souldier to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by an ignorant Cheiftaine) let our Captaine then in briefe be a man that feares God, skilfull in his profeſſion, (as hauing paſt through all the Inferior Offices below him) vertuous in his examples, wiſe in his actions, politique in his affaires, valiant in troubles, carefull in daungers and vigilant in all occaſion.</p>
               <p>For matter of his duty he ſhall bee wonderfull circumſpect in the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of his Inferior Officers, prouiding ſuch as are fit to gouerne, not ſuch as he muſt be compelld to inſtruct, and herein he ſhall giue the firſt taſte or ſeaſon of his perfection, for in chuſing thoſe which are worthy, he ſheweth the worthines of his owne knowledge, and in chuſing thoſe which are vnfit, hee expreſſeth the weakeneſſe of an ill Iudging Nature.</p>
               <p>The companie fit for a Captaine to command, are full two hundred be beſides the great Officers, for a leſſe number is Inſufficient, &amp; a greater full of trouble, it would be deuided into two equall parts, of which one would be all Pikes, &amp; the other all Muſquets, &amp; ouer both his <hi>Liuetenant</hi> ſhall gouerne abſolute in his abſence, and as the ſecond in command whenſoeuer the Captaine is preſent. He ſhall haue an
<hi>Enſigne</hi> who ſhall carry his Colours or <hi>Honor,</hi> (being of noble and no baſe mixture) Hee ſhall haue a Surgeon to whom euery Souldier ſhall allow one weekes pay towards the leuying of his Cheſt of Salues and Inſtruments: Hee ſhall haue two Drummes and two Phifes, foure
<hi>Serieants</hi> each com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding fifty Souldiers, eight Corporalls each commanding foure and twenty, and ſixteene <hi>Lanſpeſados</hi> each commanding eleauen; and out of all theſe he ſhall ellect one of the beſt vnderſtanding, whom he ſhall make the <hi>Furrier</hi> or
<hi>Harbenger</hi> for the appointing out of the allodgments for the whole Company.</p>
               <p>Touching the foure Squadrons into which the whole Body of the Companie is deuided, the firſt (which ſhall be compounded of the moſt experteſt and principall men of the companie) ſhall appertaine to the Captaine himſelfe, and bee called his Squadron (for in it the greateſt commander in the Army may traile a Pike and ſerue without diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) the ſecond ſhall belong to the Liuetenant: the third to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and the fourth to the eldeſt Serieant; this done he ſhall firſt by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and perſwations incite all his Souldiers to the ſeruice of God, which conſiſteth in <hi>Timor</hi> and <hi>Amor,</hi> then to obedience towards their<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14641:73"/>Commanders abiding in <hi>Reuerentia exhibenda, In mandato ſuſcipiendo</hi> and <hi>In Iudicio ſubeunda;</hi> and laſtly to a true performonce of their duties in all the actions of Military Diſcipline, and may bee briefely drawne into theſe few heads, ſound of the Drumme, Poſture, Diſtance and Motion.</p>
               <p>It is the Captaines duty to looke to the appeaſing of all debates, and ſo to roote out the ſeeds of ſedition that no Muteny may ſpring vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Souldiers; He ſhall ſuppreſſe (as much as in him lies) all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill liuers, &amp; where Inſtruction workes no cure, there let ſharpe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples make others fearefull; He ſhall boldly and brauely lead them on to all encounters of the enemie, charge before them and with them, and bring them off with care and diſcretion: He ſhall not at any time ſuffer them to breake their Array or March out of order, for ſuch diſorder is the ouerthrow of an Armie, and from the tolleration of one euill, will in an Inſtant ſpringe a thouſand more Inconueniences; and therefore it is the duty of a good Captaine, not to giue way to any licentious attempt, but rather by the conſtancy of his ſeuerity to take away all hope from Incorrigible and wilfull offendors.</p>
               <p>The weapon with which the Captaine ſhall ſerue in his owne perſon is very much diſputable in theſe daies amongſt the beſt Souldiers, ſome for brauery wil carry nothing but a rich Feather-ſtaffe, all wrought, guilt and curiouſly taſſelled, but this eueryone knowes is not fit to fight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, for neither is it of abilitie to wound deepe, nor of length or ſubſtance to encounter either with Pike, Partizan, Halbert, nor with a good Sword and Target. Others will ſerue with a Pike, but that is found much too vnnimble and troubleſome for his place, for hauing once brought his men vp to the puſh, he can haue no more vſe of that wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, their preſſing upon him, taking from him all meanes aboue once to charge it. And ſome will ſerue with a Sword and guilt Target, but that is found as much too ſhort, and ere he can get within the enemies Pike his life will bee in great hazard: ſo that in concluſſon (according to the oppinions of the beſt Souldiers) the only weapons for a Captaine, are a faire
<hi>Feather-ſtaffe</hi> in the time of Peace or for glory in a Garriſon, but in the time of ſeruice and in the face of the enemie, then a faire guit
<hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizan</hi> richly trim'd, being not aboue twelue inches of blade, ſharpe and well ſteeled, for it is able to encounter againſt any manner of weapon; as for the Spaniſh priuiledge to ſerue ſometimes with the
<hi>Harquebuſh,</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>Muſquet;</hi> neither are the weapons ſuiting for his place, neither can a Captaine applie himſelfe to their execution without an vtter wound to all his directions.</p>
               <p>If the Captaine be commanded to any peece of ſeruice (of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſoeuer) he ſhall goe to it willingly and cheerefully, making good all his ſuperiors directions to the vttermoſt commandment, but not excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the limits (though intic't with neuer ſo great hopes) for it is not lawfull for him to take vpon him a knowledge, which his ſuperior hath concealed from him. When his turne commeth to the Captaine of the
<hi>Watch</hi> or <hi>Guard,</hi> he ſhall ſend his Serieant to the
<hi>Serieant Maior</hi> to fetch<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14641:74"/>the Word, or to ſome other that hath order for the ſame, and by that Word (at night) he ſhall direct all his <hi>Sentinels</hi> and <hi>Corpes de Guards,</hi> and himſelfe in perſon ſhall goe the firſt Round, yet receuing the Word not giuing it; but when he pleaſeth the to ſearch <hi>Sentinels</hi> or <hi>Rounds,</hi> out of a voluntary diſpoſition, then he ſhall giue the Word and not receiue it; He ſhall be obedient to all the Supreame <hi>Officers</hi> of the Field, to his own <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell,</hi> the <hi>Liuetenant Colonell</hi> and
<hi>Serieant Maior</hi> of his owne Regiment: He ſhal prouide for all neceſſaries belonging to his company; as Money, Meate, and Munition: He ſhall euer lodge and haue his Tent amongſt them, feede with them, and giue them all the examples of hardneſſe and frugaltie.</p>
               <p>To conclude and finiſh vp this Epiſtle, hee ſhall bee of a ſweete and temperate diſpoſition amongſt them, intreating, aduiſing, inſtructing and commanding them with all the noble &amp; pleaſing Language that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Art or ſtudy can produce, and not as men teach <hi>Dogges,</hi> or Bear-wards <hi>Apes</hi> with Bitts and Blowes, for it is an vnmanly and abſurd cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, neither begetting loue nor reſpect, but Ingendring hate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment, whereas if he did rightly looke into the true nature of his condition, the Father ſhould be no more tender ouer his Children then the noble Captaine ouer his well deſeruing Souldier, for that will linke and ioyne them together as men made of one peece, and as hauing but one head to contriue, one heart to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, one hand to execute, and but one ſoule to flie to Eternity.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Owſoeuer (my Lord) the queſtion hath been diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table amongſt all the greateſt Maſters of this Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Science, whether the Captaine of Foot or the Captaine of Horſe ſhould take the prior Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, yet I notwithſtanding all the Arguments (doubtfully diſcuſſed on either part, and of which I haue alſo treated in a former Epiſtle) will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſubmit my ſelfe to the common and moſt generall receiued opinion; which is, that the Horſeman (though not in particular, yet in the ordinary vſe) ought to receiue the vpper hand in dignitie: for in <hi>France</hi> amongſt their Gentlemen at Armes, and alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Reiſters,</hi> the <hi>Lieutenants,</hi> albe they haue not place nor voyces in Marſhall Courts, yet hold themſelues in all Rankes equall with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Foot, yet not euery <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of Horſe, but ſome of an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall order, for it is to be conceiued, that in Horſe troupes all are not of one lineage (as Foot-Companies are) but differ in dignitie, order, and eſtimation, according to the worthineſſe of the Armes which the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beareth: for in the firſt times when Horſemen were in the height of their glories, the Lieutenant to a Troupe of Gentlemen at Armes, was accounted better then a Captaine of an hundred Foot; a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Launciers</hi> his equall; and a Lieutenant of <hi>Light-horſe</hi> his next and imediate younger brother, and before all Lieutenants of Foot what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer: ſo in like manner in theſe our preſent times, a Lieutenant of a Troupe of compleat armed French Piſtoliers, is reputed better in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree then a Captaine of an hundred Foot, a Lieutenant of the late
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14641:75"/>inuented <hi>Dragoones</hi> (being not aboue ſixteene inche Barrell, and full Muſquet bore) the Foot-Captaines equall, and the Lieutenant of a Troupe of <hi>Harquebuſsiers</hi> or <hi>Carbines</hi> his immediate younger Brother. Againe, Horſemen challenge the dignitie of their places according to the numbers which they hold in liſt, and according to the manner and forme of raiſing thoſe numbers; for a Captaine of a hundred Horſe (notwithſtanding any former Antiquitie) is better then a Captaine of fiftie; A Captaine of an hundred and fiftie, will euer take place of a Captaine of one hundred and a Captaine of two hundred Horſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on his left hand a Captaine of an hundred and fiftie Horſe; and ſo contrariwiſe ranking with the Foot fiftie Horſe, precedes an hundred Foot; an hundred horſe, two hundred foot, and ſo of all numbers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer: and to this the Horſemen doe adde ſundry Reaſons, ſaying, that a man may as eaſily raiſe fiue hundred Foot, as fiftie Horſe; and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, as one hundred Horſe: now if the Captaine raiſe this Troupe of his owne charges, it muſt needs argue that hee is of greater eſtate, and hath made himſelfe liable to a greater charge then any Footman can doe, and ſo conſequently deſerueth a greater reſpect from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and more ſerious reuerence from the common people. But if the Prince raiſe the Companies, then it includes, that he inferres vpon the Horſeman the greater Truſt, and ſo of neceſſitie the greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Laſtly, there is required from the Captaine of Horſe a greater vnderſtanding, and a much deeper Conſultation in the manage of his affaires then from the Footman, which greater Vertue muſt carry with it the greater Place, or elſe there will be partialitie, and not vprightneſſe in the Iudgement.</p>
               <p>Touching his Election, the <hi>Horſe-Captaine</hi> muſt haue all thoſe vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts which are acquired in the <hi>Foot-Captaine,</hi> and that with a more larger and fuller meaſure of perfection, in as much as he hath not onely to doe with Man, but with Beaſtes alſo, and muſt by the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his owne gouernment tame and bring to obedience both wilde Man, wilde Horſe, and ſometimes Boyes wilder then either the one or the other creature. And to this <hi>Faſickle</hi> or bundle of vertues (which are needleſſe againe to repeat) hee muſt haue one other excellencie added, which is as good, as great, as neceſſary, and as glorious as any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that is, he muſt bee a perfit and abſolute Horſeman, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (like one of our Signe-Saint <hi>Georges</hi>) onely how to beſtride and ſit vpon a horſe faire armed without motion, but how and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner both to mooue himſelfe and the horſe, making an vnreaſonable Beaſt doe reaſon to all his commaundements, and by the motions of his hand, legge, or body, to vnderſtand as from a ſenſible language to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all things belonging to the mans reaſonable pleaſure. In plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hee ſhall not onely bee a good Horſeman himſelfe, but alſo ſhall with diligence labour to make his whole Troupe good Horſemen, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them firſt how to ſit vpon their horſes in a faire and comely pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, carrying their bodies ſtraight and vpright, the right hand bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14641:75"/>his Launce, or Piſtoll coucht vpon his thigh, the left hand (with the Bridle raine) vnder the guard of the pommell of the Saddle, and the legs cloſe and ſtraight by the horſes ſide, with the Toes turned a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the horſe ſtanding conſtantly and firme without rage or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperance, yet in all his beautie and glory, his lip alone playing vpon the Curbe, his Necke bended, his Head couched, and the Raines of the Bridle vnſtrained, which are all the Poſtures to be vſed in ſtanding ſtill: then how to put him foorth either by yeelding of the body, or thruſting forward of the mans legs into a ſhort or large trot (with all the Poſtures beforeſaid) which is as much as is required in marching; then how by the euen ſtroke of both the Spurres to paſſe into a ſwift carriere, and firſt to diſmount the Launce from the thigh; ſecondly, to gather in the arme, and to lay open the right elbow, bringing the Launce towards the Reſt, and laſtly, to lay it vpon the Reſt, and turne the poynt inward to make good the breach or encounter, which three Poſtures are all that belong to charging: then how to gallop the field, either in large Rings, middle or leſſe Rings, either on the one or the other hand, carying his body euen and ſtraight, without bending forward or backward, or declining more to one hand then the other; and then his Launce being broken, to draw foorth his Piſtoll, with the right hand to raiſe the cocke, and either to charge it (if it haue been diſcharged) or to prepare it for a diſcharge on a ſecond encounter; and this is as much as is required in falling off, and comming on againe. Then how to manage; that is, vpon a gentle gallop to paſſe forthright in an euen line, &amp; to encounter either with the ſword or the Battle-axe, in which hee is to obſerue, firſt his Poſture of ſetting forward and drawing his Sword ouer his Bridle arme, then the raiſing of his arme, and carying it cloſe by the ſide of his body, then (at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter) the diſcharging it vpon the Helmet of the enemy, then paſſing by, and hauing broken it, to ſtop gently and vpon the halfe ſtop to turne ſwiftly and roundly, and then vpon the turne <hi>Terra, Terra,</hi> to enter into ſingle combat: then laſtly, how to retire backe, or to make the horſe flie ſidewayes either on the one ſide or on the other, according as the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of fight ſhall giue him occaſion, and in all theſe to vſe the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of vpright and conſtant cariage, both of body and weapon, which no words but practiſe, is able to deliuer to an ignorant vnderſtander.</p>
               <p>For the generall parts of this Captaines dutie (as much as concerneth the ciuill gouernment of his company) they are all thoſe which belong to the Captaine of Foot, only with an augmentation of care, in as much as he hath to prouide both for Man and Beaſt: and therfore it is his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice after the wholſome accommodation of his men, to looke to the beſt prouiſions which may be had for his horſe, according to the nature and neceſſitie of the place in which he liueth, as if it be graſſe, hay, ſtraw, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, dry corne, raw corne, pulſe, or the like, and of theſe to know which is moſt wholeſome, which vnwholeſome, and accordingly to moderate and temperat the diet of his horſes. As if he haue good dry hay, whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome graſſe, or drie corne, he may then ſuffer his horſes to feed liberally,<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14641:76"/>to reſt from trauell if occaſion be, and to water as oft as he pleaſe; but if he haue nothing for his horſe, but Forage, raw corne, or pulſe, hee ſhall then let them feed ſparingly, giue much exerciſe, and water not aboue once in a day: it is alſo meet that he know the nature of all horſe foods to preuent ſurfet and diſeaſes in his horſes; as that ſweet Hay is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing; Straw, extreme binding; and Forage, cooling and looſning; Wheat nouriſheth much, but ſoone cloyeth a horſe; dry Barley or old Mault breedeth the heart-burning in a horſe, and will (if he eat much) make him ſubiect to tyring; Rye will force him to ſhoot, ſcowre, and indeed makes a horſe weake and ſicke: but Beanes, Peaſe, and Oates (ſo they be ſweet and dry) are the moſt wholeſome and naturall for a horſe: but if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they breed the Belly-ake, Bots, and other foule diſeaſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to preuent all miſchiefes, bee ſure (if you can) to giue them rather vnthraſht then thraſht, for the ſtraw will correct many euils which would elſe follow.</p>
               <p>To conclude, for all priuat duties belonging to this Captaine, as for his <hi>Enrolling, Muſtering,</hi> receit of <hi>Pay,</hi> diſtribution of <hi>Victuals, Quartering,</hi> taking of his true

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen (my Lord) I ſaw you in the warres fighting and bleeding, your noble courage commanded my tongue to praiſe you, but when (wounded my ſelfe) I felt your bounty and fauour, you then compelld my heart to loue you. O let me to theſe two bring you a thrid (though plaine) yet an honeſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Seruant, and that is this ſhort Epiſtle, which if you ſhall pleaſe to reade, then ſhall you nobly binde my Tongue, my heart, and pen euer to ſerue you; The <hi>Sacrifice</hi> I ſend you is <hi>Warre</hi> (in it I know you haue beene well pleaſed) the <hi>Altar</hi> from whence it ariſes is mine <hi>Affection</hi> (Honor ſhould not diſpiſe it) and the
<hi>Place</hi> to which I would haue it ariue is your good <hi>Opinion;</hi> where if it find harbour like a plummet caſt into a faire calme Sea; from one poore prick it ſhall driue many large and plentifull Circkles.</p>
               <p>The courſe into which (by this warlike range) I am now conducted, brings me (in this place) to fixe vpon the Office of the
<hi>Serieant-Maior</hi> of a Regiment, or Squadron of men compounded of ſundry Companies, being as it were a little deminitiue Battell or Colonie, ouer which the <hi>Colonell</hi> is as <hi>Generall,</hi> the <hi>Liuetenant Colonell</hi> as <hi>Liuetenant Generall,</hi> the <hi>Serieant-Maior</hi> as
<hi>Marſhall,</hi> and the reſt of the Captaines as the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Commanders.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Serieant-Maior</hi> of a <hi>Regiment</hi> is euer ſome eſpeciall Captaine of moſt approoued and noble deſert (as it were) outſtriping and running before the reſt, either in <hi>Experience, Vnderstanding, Valour,</hi> or elſe (which is leaſt accountable) in the
<hi>Colonells</hi> perticuler affection, and ſo hath giuen vnto him this place of precedencie and commandment before the<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14641:77"/>reſt of the Inferior Captaines. It is true that hee ought very carefully to be choſen, both in reſpect of his Wiſdome and Temperance, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for his skill and experience, for there is much more required from him then from an ordinary Captaine, and touching the reuerence of his place, he ought to be a man of eminent note both beloued and feared, for there is in him a generall power of controlment, ſo that ſhould the leaſt want of perfection draw him into contempt, it were an vtter loſſe to his Reputation, and an infinite great weakening to the whole Seruice. It is then to be vnderſtood, that if the Regiment or Battalion conſiſt (which I wiſh, and whereto all approued Souldiers both auncient and moderne giue allowance) of one thouſand men deuided into fiue ſeuerall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, and each Company holding the contents of two hundred men a peece, that then the
<hi>Serieant-Maior</hi> hath his raunge iuſt in the mid'ſt, two marching before him (that is to ſay the Colonell and the
<hi>Liuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Colonell</hi>) and two marching behind him (which are the two young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and Inferior Companies) ſo that two command him, and two are commanded by him; yet in the abſence of the <hi>Colonell</hi> and
<hi>Liuetenant-Colonell,</hi> he then commandeth all the fiue Companies, and hath ſuperior command aboue all Captaines and Inferior Officers whatſoeuer, being as the <hi>Colonell</hi> himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Serieant-Maior</hi> of a <hi>Regiment</hi> is the imediate next degree aboue an ordinary Captaine, and reputed in all places to precead them as being their elder Brother. Now touching the effects of his duty and Office in the Regiment, he is (as before I ſaid) the <hi>Marſhall</hi> of the whole Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Squadron, and as the one ruleth and formeth what proportions ſoeuer he pleaſeth of the whole Army, ſo this man deuideth, ſubde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth, and faſhioneth what figures and formes he pleaſeth of his owne Regiment, and as the <hi>Serieant-Maior</hi> of the Armie bringeth vp, (by the appointment of the Marſhall) great Groſſes compounded of ſundry Regiments to make vp the forme and figure of the Battell he intendeth: ſo doth this <hi>Serieant-Maior</hi> of a Regiment bring vp vnto the
<hi>Serieant-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior</hi> of the Armie, either all or part of his Regiment, (in ſuch forme as hee ſhall bee appointed) to the making vp of the Groſſe and greater Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; wherein is to be noted that as Serieants of Bands are aſſiſtant to the <hi>Serieant-Maiors</hi> of Regiments for deuiding of perticular Spuadrons, Files or halfe Files, for the making vp of any Body whether it conſiſt of odde, euen, broken or whole numbers (according to directions) ſo the <hi>Serieant-Maiors,</hi> of Regiments are aſſiſtant to the <hi>Serieant-Maior</hi> of the Armie, in bringing vp to him what Deuiſions or Bodies ſoeuer ſhall bee called for, whether they conſiſt of ods, euens or any other certaine or vncertaine number, for it is a thinge impoſſible either for <hi>Lord-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall</hi> or the
<hi>Serieant-Maior</hi> of an Army, to take vpon him the manage of euery mans perticular company, or to do thoſe great and powerful du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are expected at their hands without ſome ſtrong &amp; ſufficient aſſiſtance, whence it comes that the priuate Captaines, by the aſsiſtance of the ordinary Serieants keeping their companies or order, the
<hi>Serieant-Maiors</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:14641:77"/>of Regiments by the care of the priuate Captaines keeping the Regiments in true forme, and the
<hi>Serieant-Maior</hi> of the Army by the skill of the
<hi>Serieant-Maiors</hi> of Regiments being able to forme Groſſe Bodies into what figure hee thinkes conuenient, the Lord-<hi>Marſhall</hi> of the Field may in a trice and vpon the Inſtant of any word giuen, Forme, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, change or alter any Battell according as either the aduantage of the ground, the manner of the enemies marching or any other perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler occurrent ſhal adminiſter occaſion. And that this duty may be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with all carefull ſeuerity, euery <hi>Serieant-Maior</hi> of a Regiment (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in long marches or otherwiſe) is allowed his hackney to ride on from company to company, and to looke that as the Captaines doe range their Companies in an orderly and true forme, that ſo likewiſe the whole Regiment conſiſt of an euen, iuſt and beautifull proportion, and not ſuffering any man (of what degree ſoeuer) either through <hi>Pride, Stubborneſſe, Neglect, Couetouſnes</hi> of <hi>Pilage,</hi> or any other dilitory &amp; weake excuſe, to breake or goe out of his Ranke, or to diſproportion any part of the maine Body by any rude or vncomely Poſture, but vpon the firſt apprehenſion thereof, ſeuearely to rebuke the ſame and compell a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die reformation: for it is a cuſtomary thinge in the warres that men of great Birth and qualitie doe vſually traile Pikes, and what through the guard of their Captaines fauor, the raſhneſſe of their owne youthfull wills, the preſumption of other mens examples, and the aſſuming of an vnneceſſary freedome from ſome other perticuler beholdingnes, they grow oft times diſorderly and vnruly and will not bee commanded by the ordinary
<hi>Sergeants,</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>Sergeant</hi> dare not command, where he knowes admonition will but bring backe contempt to breed a much worſe example; in this caſe the <hi>Serieant-Maior</hi> is preſently to arme himſelfe with his owne power and to let ſuch offendors know, that
<hi>Blood</hi> hath no priuiledge if once it rebell againſt
<hi>Obedience,</hi> and that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen doe runne backe from their vertue into the Baſſenes of euery earthtie condition, when they forget that their Commanders haue a <hi>Goodnes</hi> worthy their <hi>Obodience,</hi> an
<hi>Authority</hi> fit to exerciſe their <hi>Patience,</hi> and a
<hi>Knowledge</hi> to which they ought to tie their vttermoſt
<hi>Diligence;</hi> Nay, it is certaine that a Gentleman cannot expreſſe
<hi>Loue</hi> in any thing more then in <hi>Reuerence, Dutie</hi> in nothing like <hi>Obedience,</hi> nor <hi>Modeſtie</hi> but when hee admires his Commanders <hi>Excellence.</hi> Our <hi>Serieant-Maior</hi> then being a Captaine and a principall Commander, is to roote out en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities and to plant theſe vertues in euery Souldiers boſome, neither will the blood of hot and vntamed Spirits be ſo apt to boyle ouer and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede the Bounds of Rreaſon when they are commanded by a greater then themſelues, as they are when an Inferior (in their owne opinion) ſeekes to reſtraine them; And therefore it behooues the <hi>Serieant-Maior</hi> in theſe reprehentions, not only to ſhew his owne but alſo all other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers authorities that are below him, limming and painting them out in ſuch liuely (but dreadfull Colours) that hee may ſtrike a terror and feare into all offenders.</p>

               <p>The election of this <hi>Lieutenant-Colonell</hi> ought to be in the <hi>Colonel</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: for where there is not a mutuall agreement and concord amongſt and betweene all the ſuperiour Officers, but either emulation, diſtruſt, or a ſtrugling to tread downe new raiſed aduancement, riſeth againſt one another, there without all queſtion ſhall neither true diſcipline be purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor yet proſperitie buſie to attend any part of their actions: but yet notwithſtanding it many times falles out that the <hi>Generall</hi> preſerueth to himſelfe the election of theſe Officers, and either by the couenant of power, or the conſent of the <hi>Colonel</hi> eſtabliſeth ſuch as he thinketh to be moſt meet for theſe places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but howſoeuer or whoſoeuer maketh the election, it is meet it bee done with great conſideration and iudgement, and that euery man ſhould be ranged according to his deſert and merit, and that neither

It is his Office to haue a carefull and ſeuere eye ouer all the <hi>Sutlers, Vianders,</hi> and <hi>Victuall maſters</hi> within his Regiment cauſing the <hi>Serieants</hi> &amp; other Officers to looke that they Skaunce not nor exact vpon the common Souldiers, but to ſell their prouiſions at ſuch rates and aceſſements as ſhal be agreed and ſet downe by the ſuperiour Officers of the Army, without couſinage in weights, meaſures, or any vnwholeſome and vnmarkeable wares, of which offences when any ſhall be conuicted; inſtantly to ſee the ſame ſeuerely puniſhed, to the publique and fearefull example of all ſuch as ſhall be apt to runne into the ſame hazard. But if they exerciſe their Trades orderly and decently in a ciuill manner, then the

<hi>Lieutenant-colonell</hi> or the <hi>Serieant-maior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This in effect is the full continent of all thoſe duties which depend vpon this Officer, which if any deſire to haue more largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, let them be pleaſed to looke into the Office of the

<hi>Colonell;</hi> But if the Colonell bee abſent, then he hath the firſt and principall authoritie in the Regiment carrying not only his perſon but voice in euery direction.</p>
               <p>For the compoſition of a Colony of Horſe; It conſiſteth ſometimes of<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14641:81"/>three Companies or Troopes of Horſe, ſometimes of foure, but ſeldome of fiue, except it be in caſe of great fauor or eſpeciall aduancement, and theſe Companies or Troops are for the moſt part not aboue one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men apeece, ſometimes one hundred and fifty, ſeldome two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, except for the like occaſions; and the dignity of this place excelleth according to the greatnes or littlenes of the Commandment, <hi>Honor</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein ſwaied by the number of the perſons, and alſo by the nobill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the weapon; Gentlemen at armes outſhining <hi>Launceirs</hi> or <hi>Pisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leirs, Pistoleirs</hi> of more reſpect then <hi>Petronels</hi> or <hi>Carbines,</hi> and <hi>Carbines</hi> then <hi>Dragoons</hi> or <hi>Light-Horſemen,</hi> for of all theſe are compounded ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Colonies,</hi> and ouer euery <hi>Colonie</hi> ſeuerall Commanders, as the <hi>Colonell,</hi> the

               <p>The perticular duties which (aboue others) doe moſt concerne this Officer are firſt to looke that the whole Regiment bee well armed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature and qualitie of the <hi>Colony,</hi> as if they be of the two better ſorts which are to encounter Horſe againſt Horſe or Horſe againſt Pike; then to be compleat and full armed (as hath beene bofore decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) or elſe if they be of the two inferior ſorts which are to diſcouer, to ſpoyle Forragers, to Watch, to Ward, to Scout, to ſerue for great <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualgadas</hi> or <hi>Ambuſcados</hi> and to Skirmiſh, then to bee light Armed and moſt nimbly mounted (according to a former inſtruction,) and if to both theſe and the former be allowed (for euery two men) a light boy mounted on a ſmall Hackney to attend them, it will not only bring a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to the <hi>Colony</hi> but alſo make the ſeruice to be better performed, and where the <hi>Liuetenant Colonell</hi> findeth any defect in theſe armings hee is out of his owne perticuler authoritie to ſee there bee a ſpeedy Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>It is his Office to ſee that his Colonels Regiment doe not at any time loſe the true dignity of their places, but in as much as it is a Rule in Armes that in all marches the Generalls Regiment ſhall euer haue the Vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, and the reſt alternately by turnes, that is to ſay, he that this day hath the Vauntguard the next day ſhall haue the Reare; hee ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore carefully looke to thoſe changes and when his Colonels turne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth; hee ſhall challenge the ſame and not ſuffer any man to ſtep in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and his Honor; and likewiſe in what place of the Armie ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer his Regiment doth march; he ſhall obſerue that the Colonels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie continually doe take their place vpon the left wing of his owne Regiment; alſo he ſhall ſee (that in true Marſhalling of the Regiment) the Colonels, Cornet or Guiddon doe march euer vpon the head, the
<hi>Liuetenant Colonels</hi> and the <hi>Serieant-Maiors</hi> Cornets one Ranke behind the Colonels, and the Inferior Captaines, one Ranke behinde the
<hi>Liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14641:81"/>Colonels</hi> and the
<hi>Serieant-Maiors.</hi> Alſo he ſhall haue a ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the marching of euery Officer, and that they keepe their due places in due forme (that is to ſay) that the Captaine and the other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers doe each of them march vpon the head of his owne Squadron, the <hi>Liuetenant</hi> only excepted who ſhall march in the Reare accompaned with the <hi>Quarter-Maſter,</hi> and the eldeſt <hi>Corporall</hi> ſhall march vpon the head of the
<hi>Liuetenants</hi> Squadron, for it is the priueledge of his place and a due which he may require in all Armies. Againe the Liuetenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell ſhall looke to the orderly ſeperation and deuiding of all his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing them caſt into Rankes and Files according to true marſhall diſcipline, prouiding that the Files be neuer aboue fiue men deepe; for it is impoſſible to bring in depth more hands to fight at one inſtant; he ſhall alſo ſee that when they march in Battalia then they ſhocke cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and as it were ioyne Cuſh to Cuſh; But if it be to performe any Euolution or alteration of figure whether of greater or leſſer quantitie, then he ſhall ſee that they obſerue at leaſt ſixe foote diſtance (which is ſuppoſed to be a full Horſe length) betweene one horſeman and another; laſtly when Regiments come to be drawn together and ioyned one with another in their ſeuerall Battalias, then ſhal the
<hi>Liuetenant Colonel</hi> ſee that there be a double diſtance held (which is fiue and twenty Foote) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene euery ſeuerall company in his Regiment, and a double, double diſtance (which is fiftie Foote) betweeene his Regiment and any other, ſo that in all motions on Horſebacke there is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee obſerued but theſe foure certaine diſtances, the firſt <hi>Cloſe</hi> (as Cuſh to Cuſh) the ſecond <hi>Open</hi> (which is ſixe foote) the third <hi>Double-Diſtance</hi> (which is fiue and twenty foote) and the laſt <hi>Double, Double Distance</hi> (which is fifty foote) &amp; of theſe but two of them are to be vſed in diſcipline, as ether in ſeruice vpon the face of the enemie, or in drilling and exerciſing the Troops to make them perfect for ſeruice, &amp; thoſe are the firſt two, <hi>Cloſe</hi> and
<hi>Open,</hi> wherein the <hi>Liuetenant Colonell</hi> is to obſerue that when at any time he cauſeth the <hi>Squadrons</hi> to open entier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that then he muſt firſt open the Rankes and after the Files, and in clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the <hi>Battalia,</hi> he muſt firſt cloſe Files and then Rankes, and in both theſe he muſt vſe only but the two firſt <hi>Diſtances,</hi> as if he cloſe Files it muſt be <hi>Cloſe,</hi> that is Cuſh to Cuſh, leauing no ſtreete at all, &amp; if he open Files there muſt euer be ſixe foote diſtance betweene one File &amp; another; ſo likewiſe in Rankes, if hee cloſe them it muſt be to the Horſe buttocke without leauing any ſtreete at all, and if hee open them it muſt bee ſixe foote betweene the buttocke of the former horſe and the head of his follower; alſo in marches the Rankes muſt neuer open aboue ſixe foote neither in any other Motion whatſoeuer. Now that the Troops may march orderly and keepe their true diſtances in a direct and Souldierlike manner; He ſhall obſerue that whereſoeuer his Regiment mooueth, that then all moue together in one Inſtant and aſſoone as the head or Vanguard beginneth, that in the ſame time the Reare bee ready to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſo ſhall they ſtill keepe their proportion Iuſt, neither ſhall any error<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14641:82"/>be found in their proceedings. No leſſe neceſſary then theſe Rules al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared, are the words of Command by which euery Troope or Regiment is gouerned and directed, and therefore it is the <hi>Liuetenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels</hi> charge to prouide that not any Captaine in his Regiment vſe any friuolous, or new words of his owne Inuention, but only ſuch as ſhall be generally receiued through the whole Armie, for an vnknowne language is ſuch a Babilonian confuſion in the eares of an ignorant Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, that nothing but amazement and error accompany ſuch ſpeeches; Therefore the words which are continually in vſe are to be commended to euery Officers memory, which becauſe they differ in nothing from thoſe which command the foote, I will therefore referre you to that former Epiſtle in which all the generall words of directions are at large declared.</p>
               <p>For all other perticularities which ſhall neceſſarily depend vpon this great Officers duty, you muſt haue patience to behold them in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the <hi>Colonell</hi> himſelfe; to whom ſince hee is the Imediate ſecond and chiefe Subſtitute, it is therefore to be imagined that whatſoeuer the <hi>Colonell</hi> is liable to performe, that (in his abſence) the <hi>Liuetenant Colonel</hi> muſt ſee effected after the beſt and moſt reſpectiue manner that may be, for any remiſneſſe or ſlacknes in him carrieth with it a double Iniurie; one to himſelfe and another to his <hi>Colonels</hi> reputation, and in the warres euery ſmall omiſſion is dangerous, for a man ought not to erre twice. I could wander infinitly in this maze and make one occaſion beget an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but I ſhould then both breake promiſe with your Lordſhip and my ſelfe, and inſtead of an Epiſtle ſend you a troubleſome paper, but I will be faithfull to my firſt purpoſe, and only knit vp mine Epiſtle with this; That if the
<hi>Liuetenant Colonell</hi> doe containe himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bounds already preſcribed, howſoeuer a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter debt may bee challenged, yet without doubt little more can well be proued.</p>

               <p>The next great Officers preceding the former, and vpon whoſe Range I am in this place hapned, are the <hi>Foure Corporals of the Field,</hi> who haue their dependance only vpon the <hi>Serieant-maior,</hi> and are called his <hi>Coadiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> or Aſſiſtants, being (according to the manner &amp; cuſtome of our late moderne warres in number but foure and no more, who for their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to bee Gentlemen of great Dexteritie, Knowledge, and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as haue at leaſt been Captaines in other times, and for their preferments are aduanced to theſe places, wherein they haue no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar commands of any particular Companies, which doe peculiarly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14641:83"/>to themſelues, but haue a generall charge and care of the whole Army: they ought to bee men of great reſpect and eſtimation, hauing gotten that authoritie of Truſt and Beliefe amongſt the common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, through the proſperity of their affaires, that whatſoeuer they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or direct, may bee performed with a kind of religious ſeueritie, as matters of high worth and importance; for in an Army there cannot be a greater blemiſh, then when theſe men ſhall come within the compaſſe of contempt or miſdoubting. Beſides, if theſe noble parts ſhould be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent which are required in men of this high place and qualitie, the diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not only ſeazeth vpon them, but vpon the <hi>Serieant-maior</hi> alſo; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it commeth, that although the <hi>Generall</hi> himſelfe doth many times take vpon him the nomination and election of theſe Officers, yet particularly they doe belong only to the <hi>Serieant-maior:</hi> for as the whole Army is to him but one entire and full Company, ſo are theſe
<hi>Corporals</hi> his inferiour Officers, by whoſe skill and conduct he gouerneth and diſpoſeth of the whole Bodie.</p>
               <p>Touching the particular duties belonging to their place, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in all occaſions of Action to accompany and attend vpon the
<hi>Serieant-maior,</hi> who being a man of infinit imployment, as hauing a body that muſt bee almoſt in all places, and that at one inſtant, and a voyce which like thunder, muſt bee heard neere, farre off, and indeed through e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery corner; yet for as much as his materiall body cannot be ſo tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, therefore he hath theſe foure Gentlemen his Coadiutors or Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, who being diſperſed at the foure corners of the Army, doe (as the foure winds ouer the world) carry and conuay his directions ouer all the Army; which that it may be done with more fulneſſe of perfection, the
<hi>Serieant maior</hi> ſhall with theſe foure <hi>Corporals</hi> of the field from time to time continually conſult &amp; communicat both his proper Authoritie, and alſo the greatneſſe of his affaires, and making them as his eſpeciall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, by whoſe experience and skill all his endeauors are to be aſſiſted: neither ſhall he alone doe them this particular honor in himſelfe, but alſo make all Captaines and inferior Officers in the Army both to hold their perſons in reuerence, and alſo to performe their commaundements with care, reſpect, and diligence.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Corporals</hi> of the field then (being knowne Officers of this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in the fild) are to carry the directions of the
<hi>Serieant-maior</hi> ouerall the Army, and whether it march, ſtand ſtill, or fight, they are to paſſe from place to place, and ſee performed whatſoeuer ſhall proceed either from him or the Lord
<hi>Marſhall,</hi> ſometimes bringing vp Regiments, and ioyning them into greater bodies, ſomtimes deuiding and leſſening them into ſmaller parts, ſometimes ſorting and drawing one weapon from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, diſpoſing the Pikes one way, and the Shot another, ſometimes cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out ſpeciall Bands for ſpeciall purpoſes, either for <hi>Wings, Forlornes,</hi> or elſe to entertaine or relieue <hi>Skirmiſhes,</hi> and ſometimes diſpoſing of <hi>Guards</hi> for the ſafetie of the Munition and Baggage; all which as they are to performe them onely by directions, and not the authority of their<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14641:83"/>owne iudgements, ſo likewiſe they ſhal doe them ſpeedily, faithfully, and valiantly. And as thus they are vpon the dayes of battell (or when any neceſſary preparation is to be made) continuall drummes in the eares of the Foot-companies: ſo vpon commandement (likewiſe) they muſt bee ſhrill Trumpets to ſound to the Horſe-troups alſo, drawing them either one way or other, according as they ſhall be commanded, whether it bee in framing any great Body or battel, or in ſeparating Regiments, ſending ſome to guard the great Ordnance, ſome to anſwere the enemies Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſome to charge vpon the Pikes, and ſome to ſcowre off &amp; on round about the field, to ſpie all aduantages, and ſee in what part the enemy is moſt weakened. And that all theſe things may be done almoſt as ſoone as ſpoken, it is meet that all theſe foure
<hi>Corporals</hi> of the Field bee excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well mounted of moſt nimble, ſwift, tough, and well winded horſes, by the aſſiſtance of which, in a trice they may paſſe from one place to another, ſeeing euery one of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandments put in execution before they paſſe to another direction: and heerein is to be obſerued that theſe foure <hi>Corporals</hi> are to bee obeyed in all their commandements with as great feruency and reſpect as any other ſuperior Officer whatſoeuer: for indeed they are no other then their voices, nay ſometimes the voyce of the <hi>Generall</hi> or the
<hi>King</hi> himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Corporals</hi> haue the raunging of Battels, and the ſhaping or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning of the figure according to the
<hi>Serieant-maiors</hi> demonſtration, diſtributing themſelues (as it ſhal pleaſe the <hi>Serieant-maior,</hi> or Lord <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall</hi> to appoint) to ſundry weapons, one bringing vp Pikes, another Shot, a third the great Ordnance, and the fourth the Pioners or Myners: one ſhall ſend the Men at Armes one way, another ſhall ſend the Piſtoliers another way, a third ſhall giue directions to the Carbines, and a fourth ſhall place the Dragoones where their ſeruice may be moſt conuenient. Thus ſhall euery man haue his hands full, the enemy continually bee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed and offended, and Order at no time either ſhooke or broken. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall theſe Officers alone (in the action and heat of Battell) haue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regard to the managing and diſpoſing of their owne Troups &amp; Bands, but alſo ſhall keepe a vigilant eye vpon the orders and diſorders of the enemies Battels; and vpon Information thereof vnto the <hi>Serieant-maior</hi> (and receiuing new Inſtructions) with all Valour, Readineſſe, and skill to alter and frame his owne Bands anew, in ſuch wiſe as may beſt anſwere thoſe aduantages which they haue already taken: neither in theſe actions and alterations ſhall they performe them with a ſilence or dumbneſſe (as if they were afraid to awaken the Souldier) nor yet with ſuch an haſtines or raſhnes, as if the loſſe of a minute were the loſſe of the whole Army, nor yet expreſſing feare in their amazement, or tyranny in the crueltie of their Language: they ſhall not driue men before them like herds with ſhouts and blowes, neither ſhall they let them behold more ſharpneſſe in their frownes, then can bee on their enemies ſwords, but euery action which proceedeth from them, ſhall be accompanied with honorable and couragious words, whereby the Souldier may ſtill be more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed<pb n="156" facs="tcp:14641:84"/>with the loue of danger and vertue. It is alſo a part of their office, that if any Captaines, Officers of Foot-bands, or other foot Souldiers, to whom for ſome reſpects of ſicknes or infirmitie, may be (by their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours) Hackneys allowed to ride vpon, that yet notwithſtanding all ſuch (when they come within one mile of their allodgement) ſhall by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the foure <hi>Corporals</hi> of the field alight from their horſes, and put themſelues into their due and proper places, and ſo march to the place of encamping, which it is preſuppoſed the <hi>Serieant-maior</hi> and theſe foure
<hi>Corporals</hi> of the field with other Officers hath already viewed and made conuenient for their entertainment; neither being ariued at the place of encampment, ſhall any Company offer to lodge or disband it ſelfe, till they haue receiued licence and directions ſo to doe from one of the foure Corporals of the field.</p>
               <p>Many other by-authorities are transferred vpon theſe Officers, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of victuals taken from the enemy, prouiſion of fewell, lights, and other neceſſaries belonging to the night watchings, and indeed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any thing which hath a generall dependance on the whole Armie before the face of the enemy; yet in as much as they are rather intruded and thruſt vpon them by greater authoritie then rightly to be challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, I will not here daigne a recapitulation of the ſame, but finiſh vp mine Epiſtle with this aſſurance, that whoſoeuer ſhall performe faithfully what hath already been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, need not feare the debt of any greater dutie which can be demanded.</p>

<hi>Generals</hi> Liſt may freely and by their owne right be admitted; others are more eſpeciall, as where the debatement of prouiſions, the raiſing of Taxes, and the ordering of the publique affaires of the Campe are handled, and to theſe all <hi>Colonels</hi> and Officers within their range are admitted, and doe conſult and conclude with the <hi>Generall</hi> for all the proſperities and benefits which doe apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto the Armie; but the laſt <hi>Counſell</hi> of all is a great deale more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, and the matters which are handled therein are of that conſequence for ſecreſie and effect, that it were vnfit and not allowable ſo many ſhould be drawne thereunto, or that all ſorts of men ſhould pertake of euery State negotiation, or thoſe powerfull ſtratagems which indeed ſhould lodge in the ſtrongeſt and ſafeſt Boſomes, for norwithſtanding men of great experience and valor, or men of high Birth and Ranke, may in a ſhort ſpace of time aſſcend to command a Colonels place in the Field, yet may
<hi>Learning, Iudgement, Secreſie</hi> and diuers other vertues (without which a Preuie <hi>Counſellor</hi> cannot ſubſiſt) be ſo farre remoued and diſtant from his nature, that it were a ſinne againſt Safetie to admit ſuch truſt to his Boſome; ſo on the other ſide men of meaner and lower aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who are not capable of thoſe high places in the Armies, may yet be much apter to aduice and haue a better and ſtronger Fort wherein to keepe ſecrets from periſhing, then thoſe of an higher calling, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (not without good warrant) are many times choſen; and admitted
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14641:85"/>to this noble place of Truſt and preferment. But in conſideration that the Armie conſiſteth of ſo many ſeuerall great
<hi>Commanders;</hi> their is no likelihood but in ſo frequent and plentifull a choice a man may finde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now to ſupply this Roome without diſparagment, wrong or exception; neither neede it be intended that any ſuch ſhall be without an eminent place, ſince men of Godly, vertuous and experienced vnderſtandings, who are <hi>True, Secret, Liberall</hi> and of <hi>Free mindes</hi> are euer apteſt for the beſt places of what nature ſoeuer. Thus <hi>Alexander</hi> tooke <hi>Parmenio, Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and all the oldeſt of his Father <hi>Phillips</hi> Commanders to aduiſe and ſtrengthen him in all his warlike occaſions; thus <hi>Caeſar</hi> held <hi>Cato</hi> that by his aduiſe he might ruine <hi>Pompey;</hi> thus <hi>Anthony</hi> preuailed during the life of <hi>Publicola;</hi> &amp; thus <hi>Augustus</hi> held himſelfe fortunate in the counſels of <hi>Dollobella;</hi> but what neede I ſtand on theſe forraigne Inſtances, wee ſee enow to point at within our owne remembrance, did not <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Spaine</hi> giue to <hi>Don Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> that braue Souldier <hi>Don Lewis de Zuniga</hi> to counſell him in all Marſhall occaſions? and did not our <hi>Edward</hi> the third doe the like for his Sonne the Blacke Prince, when hee choſe for his Councellors the Earles of <hi>Warwicke, Suffolke, Salisburie</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> by the ſtrength of whoſe aduice in the Battle of <hi>Poyteirs,</hi> he not only ouerthrew all the flowers of
<hi>France,</hi> but alſo tooke <hi>Iohn</hi> their King and <hi>Philip</hi> his ſonne Priſoners; Infinite are the Examples to proue the neceſſitie and excellencie of a graue and aduiſed <hi>Councell,</hi> and as aboundant the Rcords of their periſhing who deſpiſing <hi>Councell</hi> haue runne raſhly and headlong on, guided by nothing but their owne opinions, for ſo did <hi>Craſsus</hi> when he brought himſelfe &amp; eleauen
<hi>Legions</hi> to be ſacrifiſed in <hi>Parthia,</hi> thus did
<hi>Tiberius Gracchus</hi> when he had his braines daſht out in the
<hi>Capitoll;</hi> and thus did <hi>Caius Gracchus</hi> who was made a bloody ſacrifice on the top of mount <hi>Auentine</hi> for the much aduiſed tempting of his fortune.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point then there is nothing more neceſſary then a ſufficent Councell of Warre; for they are more auaileable in Marſhall Diſcipline then either Armor or weapons, &amp; more braue exploits haue been acheiued by wiſdome and policie then euer could be brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by violence and darring.</p>
               <p>To ſpeake then generally of this eſpeciall and priuate Councell of Warre, and who in common Intendement are (according to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cuſtome of Nations) ſuppoſed meeteſt to ſucceed and Riſe vnto the ſame; they are theſe eſpeciall Officers following, who by vertue of their firſt places are euer capable of this ſecond: becauſe none of leſſe merit and deſert, may or ought to aſſume vnto the ſway and command of the firſt dignity. Of theſe Priuy Counſellors the
<hi>Lieutenant Generall of the Horſe</hi> hath the firſt place; the Lord
<hi>Marſhall</hi> hath the ſecond; the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the
<hi>Ordnance</hi> the third; the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> of the <hi>Warres</hi> the fourth, and the <hi>Maſter de Campo</hi> who is the eldeſt
<hi>Colonell</hi> in the Field) the fift: but if the number of Councellors ariſe to any greater extent, then they are choſen out of other great perſonages of eminence and worth at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion<pb n="160" facs="tcp:14641:86"/>of the Generall; as for the Colonels of the Infantrie they are (as before I ſaid) of a Counſell extrauagant concerning mater do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtique, but for ſuch as are either forraigne or priuate, they haue no medling at all; This priuie Counſell of Warre are to deale in matters that are profound, dangerous, and difficult, and are to argue and diſpute them with ſound vnderſtandings and cleare iudgements, whence it comes that men of meane capaſſites &amp; vnder valued Thoughts are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from theſe aproaches; and none lycenced to aſcend thereunto; but ſuch as haue high ſpirits, vnreſtrained thoughts and Princely cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which vertues in what Cabinet ſoeuer they be found, though the outſide be neuer ſo plaine and ſimple, yet is the Iewell ſo rare and precious, that Kings diſdaine not to weare them; neither ought men to faile in beſtowing of them their due Praiſe and Reuerence.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Rauell (my Lord) as a famous Diuine of our Church affirmes, perfecteth <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> and Obſeruation is the perfection of
<hi>Trauell,</hi> either of which when they are neglected or deſpiſed, a man may returne home to his Countrey like a ſtall-fed oxe to the Market, with a thicke ribbe, but a leane forehead, and how euer his body may bee couered with fat and faire clothing, yet will his mind bee emptie, thinne, and naked. That I may not bee guiltie of this careleſneſſe, I haue in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle preſumed to call your Lordſhip to bee a witneſſe of ſome part of my Obſeruations, wherein if breuitie make mee appeare more ſleight then the grauitie of the Subiect would require, my hope is you will bee pleaſed to conceiue that it is onely an Epiſtle, no ſerious diſcourſe, to which I ſtand engaged.</p>
               <p>The matter at which my Penne in this place arriueth, is the Office of the <hi>Colonell</hi> of a Foot Regiment, who amongſt the old
<hi>Romans</hi> was called the <hi>Tribune,</hi> or Ruler of the common people, and commanded a <hi>Tertio,</hi> or Regiment: the name <hi>Colonell</hi> is but moderne and new, and little longer then ſince the dayes of <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, <hi>Francis</hi> the French King, and our <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight of England, who called thoſe <hi>Colonels</hi> whom the old Spaniards called
<hi>Maistres de campo,</hi> and were ſuch as had the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of two, three, or more Captaines vnder them, yet in the firſt times it was not ſo, but theſe whom we call <hi>Colonels</hi> were then called <hi>Dux</hi> or
<hi>Duces,</hi> which ſignifieth Leaders or Directors, and of theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Romans there were three ſeuerall kindes, as firſt <hi>Duces Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tares,</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:14641:87"/>and were ordinarily thoſe which continually marched with the Armies, and had the charge of one thouſand men; the ſecond <hi>Duces Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciales,</hi> who commanded all the Souldiers within one prouince, and the third were <hi>Duces Limitanei,</hi> who had the commaundement of all thoſe Souldiers, who liued vpon the Marches or Frontiers of Countries bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering vpon the enemy, and were to withſtand all maner of aſſaults and forraine Incurſions.</p>
               <p>For the Regiment or full number of men which euery
<hi>Colonell</hi> ſhould command, they are exceeding diuers and vncertaine, at no time holding any iuſt rule or quantitie: for they ſometimes containe fiue hundred men, ſometimes a thouſand, now fifteene hundred, then two thouſand; nay, three, foure, and ſometimes fiue thouſand, and to theſe numbers of Foot haue alſo bene added ſome Horſe, but the Preſident is not vſuall: and for mine owne part as I ſaid in a former Epiſtle, I hold it beſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with good diſcipline, that no Regiment ſhould exceed the number of one thouſand, and thoſe deuided into fiue Companies, and euery Company to containe two hundred.</p>
               <p>For the election of this <hi>Colonell</hi> of the Infantery, or Foot-companies, he is principally to bee choſen by the King and Prince himſelfe, and not by the Generall, without ſome eſpeciall Commiſsion, as alſo by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Counſell of Warre, and ſome other deliberation. This Officer ought to be a man of wonderfull experience and knowledge in the Warres, and one ſo farre tranſcending all others which are of any Ranke below him, that as a <hi>Pharohs</hi> Tower, he ſhould be a Lanthorne to guide euery wandring Souldier to the perfection of his duty; nay ſo great an extent he hath for the vſe of his vertue, that being alone with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment in any place remooued from the reſt of the Armie, hee ought to haue all the perfections of Authoritie, Prudence, and Valour, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long euen vnto the Generall himſelfe, for his power is as abſolute, and his command reacheth to as large and ſpatious limits.</p>
               <p>For the particular parts of his office, he is firſt of all the abſolute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander &amp; director of al the Captaines &amp; other Officers which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Regiment, &amp; doth at his wil &amp; pleaſure diſpoſe them whether it be in quiet garriſon, in the field, or in the face of the enemy; and as they are thus to be obedient to him, ſo is he likewiſe to obey all the heſts &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of the Lord
<hi>Generall,</hi> and to doe all his appointments, of what nature ſoeuer, as whether he be commanded to the Siege, Battery, or Aſſault of any Citie, Fort, or Caſtle, whether to defend townes, tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ditches, or otherwiſe to encounter the enemy hand to hand, vpon the Champaines or places of much leſſe aduauntage, whether it be to giue Battell, to make Incurſions, to Retire, to carrie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey Bridges, to guard the Ordnance, or to performe any other war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like euolution, all muſt bee performed by him with that chearefulneſſe and alacritie of ſpirit, that hee may appeare rather to flye to thoſe encounters, then by calling doubts into his conſideration, to ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazedly fearefull like one that were drawing the picture of cowardiſe<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14641:87"/>without any Copie more then his owne Imagination.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Colonell</hi> in times paſt hath had the power to elect, or at leaſt to nominate all his owne Captaines, but ſince it hath been aſſumed and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him by the power of the Generall, ſo that now though he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all in his Regiment, yet he electeth none but his owne Lieutenant (who in curteſie hath the title of a Captaine, and in all meetings may take his place as the punie Captaine of that Regiment) his Enſigne, his Serieants and the other inferior Officers of his owne Band. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany belonging to the <hi>Colonell,</hi> ſhall take precedencie of place before all other Captaines of the Regiment, and his Colours ſhall flye at leaſt a ranke or two before any other. Now that hee may the better know how to rule and gouerne all the Officers within his Regiment, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that hee endeauour himſelfe to learne all that belongs to euery mans particular dutie, euen from the <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nſpeſado</hi> to the Office of the <hi>Serieant-maior,</hi> and to ſee that euery dutie bee iuſtly and Souldier-like performed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Colonell</hi> ought to haue his Company compounded of ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine number of men more skilfull and better experienc't then any of the reſt, with whom as well as with the Captaines, he ought to conſult, and take aduiſe in euery doubtfull buſineſſe: for it hath beene found many times by experience, that the priuate Souldier who hath ſerued in the Warres both a Prentice and a Iourney-man, will yeeld more ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide and ſubſtantiall reaſons for any vndertaking, then many more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious outſides, whoſe traffique with the Warres hath been more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and eaſie: and therefore theſe plaine (but well-vnderſtanding) men ſhall haue their payes and meanes aduaunced aboue the rate of other men, that thoſe which behold it may ſee, that vertue whereſoeuer ſhe lodgeth, will ſtill be found out and rewarded.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Colonell</hi> is to prouide that all Martiall diſcipline bee duely obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the Guards and Watches be augmented or diminiſhed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as occaſion ſhall adminiſter, that the
<hi>Lieutenant-Colonell</hi> and the <hi>Serieant-maior</hi> receiue their directions in a due and conuenient time, and that in the adminiſtration of Iuſtice hee carry an vpright and euen Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, neither ſwaruing to one hand nor the other, but gouerning all things with ſuch wiſedome and diſcretion, that the Souldiers may both loue and feare him, the Captaines grow proud to become his Imitators, and the General himſelfe reſt indebted to him for the benefit of his good and commendable examples.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Colonels</hi> power is the puniſhment of all ſorts of offences, euen to the vttermoſt of life and death; it is hee that may both make and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale Lawes and Edicts at his pleaſure, and hee is the ciuill Iudge in all cauſes and controuerſies, whether it touch honour, perſon, goods, or priuate diſſention; it is he that muſt prouide Victuals, Money, and Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell for his Souldiers; and when any ſlackneſſe is found in other ſuperior Officers, it is hee that muſt appeale to the Generall, and ſeeke reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No Captaine within his Regiment ought to entertaine any new<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14641:88"/>Souldier but by his priuitie and conſent, and eſpecially if hee bee of any forraine Nation.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the <hi>Colonell</hi> is to bee armed at all points like the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, onely his Leading weapon, and Feather-ſtaffe is of a much leſſe proportion; and albe he is a Commander of Foot, yet he hath his Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney allowed him, and ought euer to be found for the moſt part on horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe; onely when his Regiment ſhall bee commaunded to ſally foorth, and ſerue vpon the enemy, then (all his Captaines hauing their ſeuerall places aſſigned them) he ſhall alight from his Horſe, and leade foorth his Regiment in his owne perſon. Theſe are the principall parts of the
<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels</hi> Office, to which if he ſhall pleaſe to ioyne
<hi>Experience</hi> in things to be done; <hi>Knowledge</hi> by Hiſtories, of things which haue beene done; if he haue an vnſpotted <hi>Fame,</hi> an vndaunted <hi>Heart,</hi> and a belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>diſpoſition;</hi> if
<hi>Goodneſſe</hi> guard him, and <hi>Fortune</hi> ſerue him, let

               <p>I need not inſiſt much vpon his election ſince I haue already named the place Noble, which inferreth as great and as ſinguler vertues as can by any tongue be named, by any pen deſcribed, by any heart conceiued, neither need I make my way long and tedious in coming vnto the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts of his duty, eſpecially ſo much as concerneth the ordinary common-wealth and wholeſome gouernment of his Regiment, in Health, in Concord, in Plenty, and in the performance of true Marſhall Diſcipline, ſince indeed he is ſo neare a Kinſman, nay rather Brother or Fellow Companion with the <hi>Colonell</hi> of the <hi>Infantrie,</hi> that in obſeruing the firſt, this latter doth (as it were) dilate and lay it ſelfe open to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence and apprehenſion of euery indifferent Iudgement, yet for as much as the alteration of weapon, and addition of the Horſe breedeth a diuerſitie in ſome particuler duties; therefore to thoſe I will returne and ſhew how they are to bee mannaged in the deſignes of warre-like preparations.</p>
               <p>It is a very materiall thing and an eſpeciall duty in euery
<hi>Colonell</hi> of Horſe to looke that all his Regiment be well mounted and armed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that proportion of Armes ouer which he is to Gouerne; as if his Regiment conſiſt of Gentlemen at Armes, that then they be compleate armed in good Armor of high proofe from the cloſe <hi>Caske</hi> downe to the

To euery Gentleman at Armes ſhould belong, three, foure or more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants mounted on Horſe-backe, though in a lower Ranke, who are to waite vpon their neceſſaries, and to take charge of their ſpare Horſes, for theſe men at Armes are all intended to bee men of great Blood and Qualitie, to be the owners of Rich Eſtates, and ſuch as follow the wars only for <hi>Honor</hi> and the loue of vertue, and put themſelues vnder com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, not ſo much for Inſtrution as for orders ſake and to leaue behind them the benefit of a good example. If his Regiment conſiſt of Piſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leers, he ſhall ſee them armed compleat to the Cuſh; ſtrong Horſes or Guelding of the largeſt ſize, deep Saddles, broad Trappings, a faire Sword<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14641:89"/>and a long Piſtoll.

               <p>When he hath his Regiment thus orderly armed, it is then the duty of the <hi>Colonell</hi> to looke vnto their March, their place of attendance, and maner of Seruice, as if they be men at <hi>Armes,</hi> (who are heauily armed) then their Marches muſt be ſlow and ſeldome, as namely, when the Army doth diſlodge, and not vpon euery ſleight occaſion. Their place is vpon each ſide of the maine Battell, yet in a ſomewhat remoued and farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, for in marching too nere the foote bands they may giue offence, as being ſodainely enforced to charge &amp; then wanting ſufficient ground for retraite, they often fall in amongſt their owne bands and ſo compell them to Rout and diſorder; their ſeruice is two fould, for they muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encounter with the enemies Men at armes, or elſe breake in amongſt the Pikes, and diſranke or ouerthrow them; they are alſo ſometimes to relieue the <hi>Carbines</hi> or <hi>Dragoons</hi> when they are ingaged, and in retraits to make ſtands vpon the enemies, and ſo keepe them from the execution. If they be <hi>Piſtoliers</hi> then their March is more ſwift and more generall; yet not ſo great as to be worthy the name of Trauell; their place is a good pretty diſtance before the men at Armes, and they troope together in large Squadrons, the <hi>Cornet</hi> being lodged within three of the firſt Rankes, and their Seruice is to breake vpon the Battell of Pikes after they haue beene a little ſhaken and diſrankt by the men at Armes, by volleys of Short, or any other amazement; alſo they doe ſometimes encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the enemies horſe, &amp; doe follow the chaſe to finiſh vp the execution. If they bee <hi>Carbines,</hi> their March is ſodaine and vpon moſt occaſions; their place is before the
<hi>Pistoleirs</hi> and the troupe in wings, or ſleeues with their
<hi>Guydon</hi> placed in the middeſt of the Rankes, as for their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, it is principally againſt the Foote-ſhott, eſpecially in Champaines where they are vnguarded, either with <hi>Hedge, Ditch, Wall,</hi> or other place of aduantage. Laſtly, if they be <hi>Dragoones,</hi> their march is for the moſt part, vpon the ſwifteſt gallop; their place in Scouts, Forragings, and vpon all needfull diſcoueries; and the effect of their principall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice is to defend and make good all paſſages ouer Riuers, as
<hi>Foards, Bridges, Mill-dames,</hi> and the like, all <hi>Strait wayes, Hills, Valleyes,</hi> and other places of Retraite, they may vpon occaſion alight from their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſerue on foot, ſpoyling all Forragers and Pillagers, aſſayling Troupes in their lodgings, and when they finde themſelues drawing into any inconuenience, they may preſently mount againe and retyre into their ſafety. But if they be ſo farre engaged that they cannot well come off, then muſt the armed <hi>Piſtoleirs</hi> come in and aſsiſt them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this caſe the <hi>Colonell</hi> is to foreſee that in the compoſion of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, the <hi>Dragoones</hi> be choſen from the ableſt, nimbleſt, and moſt<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14641:90"/>actiue men that can be got, being of that dexteritie and quicknes of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that they may be able to vault to and from their Horſes at pleaſure, and to carry their Pieces ſo cloſe guarded in their left hands, that in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of any of theſe ſuddaine actions there may bee found neither trouble nor hinderance; laſty when they haue performed their duties they ſhall then retyre behind the <hi>Piſtoliers</hi> and there prepare themſelues againe for a new onſet.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a ſpeciall care belonging to this
<hi>Colonel,</hi> to giue directions for the daily trayning and teaching of his Regiment, eſpecially if they ſerue with fire on Horſebacke, for if a man be neuer ſo good a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and yet but an ill Shot, or if he be neuer ſo good a Shot, and yet but an ill Horſeman, there will be ſuch diſparity and vntowardneſſe in his actions that all his labour will be to little and no purpoſe; let therefore diligence and practiſe, good opportunity and good inſtructions make the Souldier exquiſite in what he vndertaketh, and it will bring honor to the <hi>Colonell,</hi> and benefit to the generall Seruice. And that the Seruice may be the more effectually performed, it is requiſite that the <hi>Colonell</hi> haue euer attending vpon his perſon (as his dayly and houſhold ſeruants) an excellent Smith, or Farryer, who ſhall euer be furniſhed with Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhooes, nayles, and drugges, both for inward and outward applycations; a very good Sadler, and all things belonging to his occupation, and a skilfull rough Rider, that may tame and reclayme ſtubborne Iades, and inſtruct the Souldier how, and in what manner to become a reſonable Horſeman.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all it is the <hi>Colonels</hi> duty to haue a perfect Rolle of all the Bands within his Regiment, as well Officers, as others, ſeeing them mounted and armed, and then giuing allowance to their ſufficiency, hee ſhall giue directions for the diſpoſing of the Troopes.</p>
               <p>From him or his Subſtitute, the Trumpets ſhall take all commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and whenſoeuer the Regiment riſeth, the <hi>Colonels Cornet</hi> ſhall firſt flie abrord, to which all the reſt ſhall repaire, and from him ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue order for their imployment, whether it be to Watch, to Scour, to diſcouer or elſe to relieue others: He ſhall appoint ſuch as ſhall guard the Lord <hi>Marſhall,</hi> the
<hi>Forrage-Master</hi> and the <hi>Victuallers:</hi> He ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the manner of all Skirmiſhes, and ſo place, his Troupes that one may ſecond the other in ſuch wiſe: that if any be repulſt yet being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued they may haue time to regather themſelues into order, and either mainetaine a ſecond onſet or retire backe againe into their owne ſtrength; This is the full effect of the <hi>Colonels</hi> Office that commandeth Horſe, and theſe things (with the reſt which belong to the
<hi>Colonell</hi> of Foote) being ſeriouſly obſerued, his place ſhall be fulfilled with much renowne, and his perſon adorned with vndying Honor.</p>

               <p>It is the Serieant-maior Generals office vpon any day of Battayle to goe to the Generall or <hi>Colonell Generall</hi> and from one of them to take his directions; knowing whether the Generall will haue his owne Regiment to haue the vant-guard or no, or otherwiſe the Battayle or reare; which reſolued he ſhall then atend the Lord Marſhall to the ellection of the field, In which it behotueth the Serieant-maior to be very skilfull in the ſituation of the Country and to know the diſtance of places and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of euery paſſage with all the ſeuerall circumſtances which ſhall depend vppon the ſame, as well for the guard and ſafety of his owne, as for the hindrance and anoyance of the enemy ſo that althings being aſſured, he may then cauſe the Drumme-maior to beate a remoue, and all the Captaines being aſſembled to the place of armes; he ſhall thence (by the directions of the Lord Marſhall) draw forth the Battayle, diſpoſing euery Commander into the places which are moſt conuenient, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his <hi>Maniples</hi> and diuiſions ſutable to the paſſages through which they are to march, yet by no meanes into a leſſe then a third or elſe fourth part of the front, and keeping euery diuiſion iuſt tenne deepe and neither more nor leſſe, and herein he ſhall haue reſpect, that in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp the <hi>Maniples</hi> to make an entyre Battayle, the Enſignes may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their due places, as namely the Generalls vppon the head, the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant generall, the Lord Marſhall, the Maſter of the
<hi>Ordnance,</hi> the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,</hi> the <hi>Colonell general,</hi> and the <hi>Serieant-maior Generall</hi> one ranke within the Battell, the Colonels of the Infantiue a ranke behinde them, and the Captaines a rank behind them. He ſhall haue an eſpeciall care for the ſafe garding of the munition &amp; baggage, placing it either before, behind, or on any ſide where the enemy is leaſt ſuſpected, It is at his diſcretion to make ſtands (which ſome call Altoes or Hallts) when and at what time he pleaſe; whereby the ſouldier may be refreſht when he is weary with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and it muſt be done in places fit and commodious for the ſame, as where there is cleane running water, ſome ſhelter, yet a large proſpect, ſo as no ſouldier may offer to ſtraggle, but the Officers may both perceiue him, &amp; reprehend him. Now that all theſe duties may be the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, this Officer is intended to be euer on Horſebacke, yet not vpon a horſe of warre, but rather vpon a comely and nimble Hackney, on which he may ride in amongſt the Ranks, &amp; paſſe from File to File, ſeeing euery man to performe his dutie in a carefull and modeſt manner, and herein is to be obſerued, that if in his paſſages to &amp; fro, he doe happen to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or meet with the <hi>Generall</hi> (although on foot) yet ſhall not the <hi>Serieant-maior</hi> alight from his Horſe, but keepe his ſeat, for it is his particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, neither ſhall he diſmount at any time in the day of battel, for any ſuch errour is a cloud betwixt him and glory; for being on foot, he is no more then one man, but mounted on horſebacke, and aſſiſting with<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14641:92"/>directions, he ſupplieth the places of many hundreds; his Armour muſt be light and nimble, being the ſame pieces which belong to a Foot-Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and in his right hand he ſhall beare a Trunchion, with which hee may correct any man that wilfully offendeth, as alſo with it to ſeperate vnruly horſes, carriage, or baggage which troubles the Battalions, or to demonſtrat and point out to any thing which he commandeth; his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary place is neere the perſon of the Generall, or the Colonell generall; for from them hee muſt take many inſtructions: if any Squadrons or maine Bodies be broken, hee is to bring Supplies, and ſawder them vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: he is called the Guide of the Battel, and therfore to looke that all things ſucceed rightly. When the Army is encampt, hee giueth the firſt directions for the <hi>Corps de guards,</hi> &amp; charge for the <hi>Sentinels;</hi> it is he that reacknowledgeth the Quarters, and taking his orders from the Lord <hi>Marſhall,</hi> prouideth for the generall ſafty of all the Armie, as the Watch, the Ward, the Scout, Guard for the Munition, Entrenchments and the like, of all which I haue entreated ſomething in the former Offices.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Serieant-maior</hi> is firſt to take notice of alarmes of all kinds, and to examine the cauſes, then to giue information to the
<hi>Generall</hi> and Lord <hi>Marſhall,</hi> and ſo to proceed according to order.</p>
               <p>It is a very landable dutie in the <hi>Serieant-maior Generall,</hi> if in the day of Battell, he ſelect and appoint a certaine number of Souldiers, who from time to time ſhall draw forth the hurt, maimed, and ſlaine parties, which elſe would trouble the Squadrons, and to conuey them to cure, or other place for other purpoſe. It is his office to appoint the orders and formes of <hi>Camiſados</hi> and <hi>Ambuſcados,</hi> to direct the place where, the order how, and the manner and forme of Silence: he ought to awaken and ſtirre vp the Generall to the prouiſion of all kind of Armes, and is to ſee the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of euery Regiment ſupplied. To conclude, he muſt be a generall Father ouer all the Armie, and to prouide the good of the Souldiers, as for his naturall children: he is to heare the complaints of all the inferior <hi>Serieant-maiors</hi> of Regiments, and to ſee that they may haue ſpeedy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatches. This is the greateſt ſubſtance, and the moſt materiall parts which depend vpon this great Officer, which his owne vnderſtanding may amplifie according to the adminiſtration of occaſions; ſo that fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowledge and vſe together, the world will become rich by his help, and others much fortified by his encouragements.</p>

<hi>Leiceſter</hi> into the <hi>Low Countreys;</hi> he diſcharged this place with all honour, all admiration; and was without doubt Infinitely worthy of the ſame, for he was ſonne in law to the <hi>Generall,</hi> highly recommended by the Queenes Maieſtie and a man borne of a Millitary, noble and renowned father; and although he were at that time but twenty yeeres of age, yet he was of that Infinite greatneſſe of ſpirit, and had a minde ſo excellently compounded of all maner of vertuous inclinations, was ſo great a louer of Iuſtice and in him ſelfe ſo much bound to the perfections of Temperance and Iudgement, that neuer man ruld in a place or came off from a place with more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and leſſe enuie, for he held (as it were) a continuall trading with the elder and more experienſt <hi>Souldiers,</hi> framing all his affrayres by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices; and by his Affabilitie and Bounty (though his eſtate could neuer boaſt of Infinites) wanne ſuch reſpect and loue amongſt all men, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time nor the powerfulneſſe of any great wrath, was euer able to find a tombe in which to incloſe his memorie; But ſome will ſay this preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is rare and may not inferre an authoritie, but I ſay no; for as it, I could recite a world of others did not the breuitie whereunto I am tyed reſtraine me.</p>

               <p>This great Officer (of whom I am now to intreat) ought only to bee choſen by the King, and although Princes doe not euer looke to the Nobilitie of his Blood, yet ought they moſt preciſely to reſpect the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of his minde and naturall inclinations; for the Treaſurer of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ought to be a Gentleman, Wiſe, Frugall, not Couetous, yet rich (and what is almoſt a miracle) a man of infinite compaſſion; He muſt bee Wiſe both in reſpect hee is euer of the Priuie Councell of the warres, and ſo bound to diſcerne and looke into all occurents, as alſo in that he is to iudge of the neceſſities of mens occaſions, and ought by
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14641:97"/>a foreſeeing Iudgement to know how and in what manner to inlarge Bounties; he muſt be Frugall becauſe he is truſted with the Kings Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (which is the Nerues and Sinewes of the Warres) which by any lauiſhnes of an open and vnreſtrained hand will ſoone diſſipate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume away without returne of Benefit to the Kings ſeruice; preferment to him who liueth vpon vnfit Gaines, or Honor to him whoſe hand was guided with a blind imagination: But if he arriue at the vice of Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe which is the roote of all miſcheiues; Infinite muſt the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities be which will grow from his Branches, as cooſnage in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of ſuppoſed fees, extortion in loanes before hand, &amp; vnmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vſurie vpon euery due ſumme, contrarie to the very rule of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills prerogatiue; beſides a moſt generall defrauding of the Prince with falſe accounts, vniuſt ſuppoſed debts, and a world of other deſceptions: that he ought to be rich there is nothing more neceſſary, both becauſe he may be the better able to make account and render ſatisfaction, (in caſe the Diuell and Couetouſnes drawne him to diſorder) as alſo by his credit and reputation, to bee able to take vp and raiſe new ſummes, if the Treaſure chance not to come in, according to expectation. Now laſtly that he ought to be compaſſionate and full of mercy I appeale to the conſcience of euery poore Commander and Souldier, who (If hee ſhould out of the cruelty of a curriſh diſpoſition bind himſelfe to pay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which were due, nor any thing before it is due) would without all queſtion periſh ſometimes for want of foode, if too great a ſeuerity were obſerued.

               <p>The Treaſurer muſt haue vnder him many
<hi>Subtreaſurers</hi> and inferior Officers, all which ought to be exceeding skilfull in Audit and matter of account; of which ſome are to keepe a diligent account of his receits &amp; charges where with he may be burdned, &amp; ſtandeth accountant; others of his disburſments &amp; layings out, keeping true bookes of account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the vpper <hi>Treaſurer</hi> and all Officers of receits through the whole Armie; hauing the acquittances of euery Regiment by themſelues, and faire bookes of record by which to approue euery acquittance.</p>
               <p>Ouer theſe Inferior Officers the high <hi>Treaſurer</hi> is with a carefull eie to looke, prouiding by all meanes that they take not extraordinary fees, or by any arteficiall flatterie or promiſe of fauors; incite free Spirits to inlarge or increaſe their fees, making the hundred penny (which I know<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14641:97"/>not by what right the challenge) ſometimes ſixe pence and ſometimes twelue pence more then the true Sum amounts to, for indeed all is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion or at leaſt an vſurie of an vnlawfull creation. Beſides it is neither lawfull for the high

               <p>It is a thing moſt iuſt, honorable and fit in Princes to pay duely; for the leaſt failing is a Scourge that whippes forward Inconueniences; and <hi>Treaſurers</hi> in the warres, if they get but the colour of excuſe from the Princes forgetfulneſſe, know (as the prouerbe ſaith) with a wet finger where to finde Oppreſſion, and then fornicating with that cloud beget practiſes and cruelties worſethen ten thouſand

               <p>To conclude, this eminent and great Officer with his dependants and <hi>Subtreaſurers,</hi> as the <hi>Purueyor-generall, Victuall-maſter, Pay-maſter, Clerks</hi> and others, ought to bee carefull that contentment bee giuen from the beſt to the meaneſt Creature in the Armie, remembring that the foode of words and Aire are of ſuch crude and hard diſgeſtion, that they are not only dangerous to mans life, but alſo breed in men ſuch wicked and<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14641:98"/>euill Spirits, that the plague and mortalitie of a conſuming Rancon hardly euer after departs from their boſomes.

<hi>Artillery</hi> or <hi>Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the Campe, ſo hee hath care of all the Forts, Caſtles, and fortified places which are remoued, or lie farre off from the Campe; yet in the guard and reſpect of that Armie, neither hath he alone the care of their ſaftie, but alſo the manner how to keepe them ſafe, and to that end<pb n="186" facs="tcp:14641:99"/>is to draw ſundry circumſtances into his conſideration, as the ſituations and ſtrengths of all places whatſoeuer, whether <hi>Mediterranell</hi> or <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> mountainous or plaine, or indeed any or all of theſe conioyned and mixt together; then what places are ſtrengthened by Nature, and what muſt bee made ſtrong by Art, the forme of the ſtrength, as being fitteſt both to defend it ſelfe, and offend the enemy, the ſeueral ſorts of formes, as whether it be circular, ſquare, or contriued into many angles: and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the matter wheron the ſtrength is made, as whether it be Earth, Stone, Bricke, Timber, or any other materiall and binding ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>He is alſo to draw into his conſideration the nature and qualitie of all Fortifications, and that they are made and framed as well to withſtand the offence of Artillery, as to defend and keepe able themſelues by the helpe of Artillery; and for this cauſe it is moſt neceſſary that the Maſter of the Ordnance bee skilfull in the knowledge of all ſorts and ſizes of great Peeces, as whether they bee Royall (which are the greateſt) or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Royall (which are the leſſer) yet all to be imployed in the matter of Battery. The Royall are thoſe which we call the <hi>Culuerin,</hi> the <hi>Quarter Cannon,</hi> the <hi>Demy cannon,</hi> the <hi>Cannon,</hi> the
<hi>Double cannon,</hi> the <hi>Cannon-Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> the
<hi>Baſiliſco,</hi> and indeed any peece which ſhooteth a Bullet from ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteene pounds weight or vpwards: and the Vnder-royall are the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my culuerin,</hi> the <hi>Saker,</hi> the <hi>Minion,</hi> the <hi>Falcon,</hi> the <hi>Falconet,</hi> the <hi>Rabinet,</hi> the <hi>Harquebuſſe a Croek,</hi> and indeed any peece which ſhooteth a Bullet from ſeuenteene pound weight downewards, and this Ordnance is the Maſter not onely by his authoritie and potents to prouide and raiſe, either by put chaſe, prize, or caſting, as the abilitie of the place where hee reſideth will affoard, but alſo to ſee them mounted either vpon Carriages for the field, vpon Bulwarks, Forts, Caſtels, Towne-wals, or any other place of defence or offence, as ſhall appeare beſt in his iudgement: and to this end he ſhall be of approoued iudgement in all manner of Fortifications, and able to direct the inferior Officers vnder him (as the <hi>Lieutenant of the Ordnance,</hi> the <hi>Engine-maſter,</hi> the <hi>Trench-maſter, Captaine of the Pioners,</hi> and the like) in the framing of <hi>Bulwarks, Curtaines, Caualeros, Tenazas, Tize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Dientes, caſamats, Teraplenes, Trenches, Ditches,</hi> or any thing belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their owne ſafetie, or the enemies annoyance; as alſo how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortifie any place that is decayed, or in the firſt erection by ill directions hath been made contrary to Art, whereby the platforme is to bee new moulded and reformed: and herein he ought to be capable of diſcerning (vpon a ſerious view) any hindrance and annoyance whatſoeuer, which ſhall accompany his worke, as whether it be without the ſituation of the worke, as if there bee hills, plaines, riuers, lakes, valleys, rockes, woods, vineyards, orchards, gardens, monaſteries, old Churches, or any other Edifices, Seas, Iſles, Bayes, or the like, or elſe within the ſituation, hauing regard to the wall, and euery quality thereof, the height and thickneſſe of the <hi>Terraplene,</hi> the ſtrength of the Gates, the depth of the Ditches, whether wet or drie, how waters are conuaid into it, whether by open and naturall channels, or by cloſe and ſecret Conduits, the altitude of the<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14641:99"/>place, as whether it be aboue or below other buildings that are about it, with a world of other obſeruations; all which if they breed any annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or inconuenience he ſhall be able immediatly to reforme and cure, making the place ſafe and ſtrong, howſoeuer Nature hath promiſed the contrary; and in this worke hee ſhall haue great care to husband euery thing as frugally as is poſſible, &amp; to be reſpectiue ouer the Princes purſe, vſing Stone where ſtone is plentifull, Bricke, where Bricke is made, and Timber, where Timber groweth; and where any of theſe are wanting to vſe either ſtrong Turfe or Earth, or any other matter which the place affoordeth.</p>
               <p>As thus the <hi>Maſter of the Ordnance</hi> hath theſe Commandements in remote, forraine and out places, ſo hath he in the Campe as eminent and great controlments; for there the generall charge of the whole Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery dependeth vpon him and his neceſſary ſubſtitutes, of which the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall are the <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> the <hi>Clerke of the Ordnance,</hi> the <hi>Pay-maſter,</hi> the <hi>Purueyor Generall,</hi> foure

<hi>Enginers</hi> and <hi>Refiners,</hi> and a Guard both of Foot and Horſe, Gentlemen and <hi>halberdiers,</hi> and ouer all theſe ſeuerall places (of the moſt materiall whereof I haue already written) he is the chiefe Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendant, and hath the power to diſpoſe of all things according to his pleaſure and Iudgement, as alſo hee hath the commaund, choiſe and controllment of all Gunners and Cannoniers whatſoeuer, and both giueth vnto them their ſeuerall allowances, and doth allot them their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall attendants.</p>
               <p>It is alſo in the power of the <hi>Maſter of the Ordnance</hi> to preaſe and haue vnder him both Ship-wrights, Boat-wrights, and other neceſſarie Carpenters, who at his appoyntment ſhall frame Boates, Barges, and other Veſſels, which may bee portable, and at pleaſure taken in ſunder and ioyned, for the tranſportation and carriage of the Army ouer any great riuers, or ſmall armes of the Sea, by faſtning thoſe Boats together, and making Briges thereof ſtrongly boarded &amp; planckt, and well rayled on either ſide, as hath been done in diuers forraine Armies, and alſo with vs here at home in the yeare Eightie eight, when the Armie &amp; prouiſions were paſſed ouer the Thames betweene Kent and Eſſex: ſo that of theſe Boats for Bridges ſhould neuer be in the Army vnder the number of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie at the leaſt, ouer which charge (vnder the

               <p>The Maſter of the <hi>Ordnance</hi> appointeth vnder his hand-writing the numbers and proportions of all maner of prouiſions of Munition which ſhall attend the Armie, and deliuereth it to the

               </p>
               <p>Vnder the command of the <hi>Maſter of the Ordnance,</hi> is the <hi>Cariage-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> the <hi>Clerke</hi> of the Cariages, the

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here be two things (moſt noble Lord) which aboue all others doe moſt weaken and diſtracte the Senſe of the painefuleſt writer, that is a Serious and deepe Subiect, and a learned and well Iudging Eare, at both which I am arriued in this Epiſtle; for the matter being <hi>Warre</hi> howeuer neglected by Ignorance, yet amongſt the beſt knowledges hath beene of ſacred eſtimation; and your noble Eare (to whom I conſecrate theſe much vnpoliſht and Rude gatherings) hath ſo longe beene fed with all the excellencies which Art is able (in his beſt Trimme) either to inuent or adorne: that there is nothing can poſſibly proceed from me (if it haue any good Seaſon) which hath not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beene more gloriouſly lodged in your owne moſt Noble Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; Blame me not then (honord Sir,) if I a little ſhake in this Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hauing mine owne wants to leade me, and your vertues to amaze me, the action may very well become my feare, yet if (out of your greater goodneſſe) you ſhall be pleaſed to giue ſtrength to mine attempt, I doubt not but that courage ſhall awaken in me ſome new induſteſie which may proue worthy both of your view and Studie.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Marſhall</hi> of an Armie aboue all other Officers ought to be a moſt approued Souldier, for howſoeuer in the greatneſſe of other great places in the warres; there may be a diſpenſation of skill; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and Vertue being as requiſite as Knowledge &amp; Iudgement, yet in this Office it may not be ſo, for this man aboue all others hath the<pb n="190" facs="tcp:14641:101"/>greateſt place of action and direction in all the Armie, and howſoeuer he hath more to command then any, yet all they haue no power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence or leſſen the leaſt dutie belonging to his perſon, for howſoeuer the <hi>Generall</hi> or
<hi>Liuetenant-Generall</hi> may precede him in place, yet they ought not in knowledge, ſince both themſelues and the whole Armie, both Horſe and Foote are bound to moue only by his direction; and though to the
<hi>Generall</hi> (who is his Commander) hee may not ſay <hi>this</hi> or
<hi>that</hi> you muſt doe, yet he may ſay here and in this place your Honor ought to ſtand; and therefore what manner of man this great perſon ought to be, for Wiſdome, Temperance, Valour and Vertue, euery one is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to diſcribe and Iudge, then to finde out a perſon ſutable to the imployment.</p>
               <p>Next the <hi>Generall</hi> the Lord <hi>Marſhall</hi> hath the ſupreame command of the whole Field, and therefore his Trumpet is firſt in the morning to diſcharge the Watch, and his Troope ought firſt of all to bee mounted; for it is an honor which the Armie alloweth him by reaſon of the infinit paines which he taketh in his owne perticuler perſon, neither ſhall his Troope Watch or Ward but are diſcharged of that duty by reaſon of their other more ſerious occaſions. After He and his Troope are moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he marcheth to the outmoſt borders of the Campe and there makes a ſtanſt till the whole Armie be Ranged, neither quits his place till the laſt man be on foote; He is himſelfe in all things both aſſiſtant and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectiue to the <hi>Generall</hi> of the Horſe and the <hi>Serieant-Maior.</hi> All the day longe he is tied to no Battalion, but at his owne pleaſure may beſtow his owne perſon; ſometimes accompaning the <hi>Generall,</hi> ſometimes leading his owne Troope, and indeed alwayes where the greateſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of neceſſity is and where the enemie is moſt likely to aſſaile and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, for his place is moſt honorable and where honor is, there ſhould be his reſidence. As his perſon, ſo his Troope alſo is not tied to any eſpeciall or certaine place, but may varie and alter as danger and honor ſhall giue occaſion, ſtill ſupplying whatſoeuer is weakeſt, and as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Champion muſt continually bee ready to entertaine the enemie vpon all his approaches, &amp; at night vpon retraits; the Reare is his place and he bringeth it vp with courage and ſafetie; then being come to the Campe he ſtayeth till euery man be diſmounted and the whole Armie lodged, and then he with his Troope diſmounteth; he taketh oder for the Scouts, aduiſeth with the <hi>Serieant Maior</hi> for the Guards, vieweth the ſtrengths of the Campe and ſeeth there be no decay in the ditches or entrenchments.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Marſhall</hi> is the ſupreame and only powerfull Iudge in all cauſes of Life and Death, in criminall offences and controuerſies of all manner of natures, and prouideth for the due execution of all the <hi>Lawes, Bandos, Articles</hi> and Inſtitutions which ſhall be appointed by the <hi>Generall</hi> to be obſerued and to ſee due puniſhment executed for any breach of the ſame; whence it proceeds that he ought to be exceeding well read and learned in all Marſhall Lawes, the cuſtomes of Countries,<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14641:101"/>the degrees of Honor and the diſtributions of Bloods, places and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that he may the better proceed in theſe affaires; he is to bee aſſiſted with diuers learned and experienc't Officers vnder him; as the Iudge-<hi>Marſhall</hi> and
<hi>Prouoſt-Marſhall</hi> (of whoſe Offices I haue already written,) an Auditor and two Clerkes, the vnder <hi>Prouosts, Gaoylers</hi> and
<hi>Executioners, Corigidors</hi> or <hi>Beadles</hi> to punniſh the
<hi>Infragantie</hi> or vnruly; and twenty or thirty Gentlemen for a continuall Guard about him: The <hi>Iudge-Marſhall</hi> is to aſſiſt him in all difficult &amp; curious interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the lawes, and in deciding ſuch controuerſies as ſhall happen in the taking of priſoners, in the flying of Colours, and in ſitting in <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall</hi> Courts according to the dignity of places; he is to direct the <hi>Scout-Master</hi> in all his proceeding and to receiue from him all the Intelligences and obſeruations which he hath found out in his diſcoueries, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vnto him any other inſtructions which had formerly beene neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
               <p>It is the Office of the Lord <hi>Marſhall</hi> to giue order to the Maſter of the <hi>Ordnance</hi> both for his march and for his paſſage, both where, when and which way all his prouisions ſhall goe for the beſt aduantage and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetie, and at the planting of Artillerie or making of Batteries, the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall</hi> is to ouerſee the proceedings, and to giue directions vpon any doubt or miſaduenture; he is to giue order vnto the Victuall-maſter, Waggon-maſter and all Officers of their natures, both for their allodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Stores and all other neceſſarie accomodations; and againſt all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences or iniuries which ſhall bee offerd them, hee is to ſee a carefull and ſpeedy Reformation.</p>
               <p>When the Armie is to bee incamped in any new place, the
<hi>Serieant-maior-generall,</hi> the <hi>Quarter-maſter-generall,</hi> the

<hi>Quarter-maſter-generall,</hi> and the <hi>Scout-maſter-generall</hi> ſhall aſſigne the place wherein the Campe ſhall be pitched, the manner, forme and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion it ſhall carry, the bounds it ſhall containe, and the diſtinction of euery place and commoditie, aduantage, ſtrength or diſcommoditie, which it ſhall pleaſe him to annexe vnto the ſame; and according to his pleaſure and demonſtration, ſo ſhall the
<hi>Quarter-maſter-generall</hi> ſee it deuided, leauing the intrenchment to the <hi>Trench-maſter,</hi> and the other Inferior deuiſions to the
<hi>Serieant-maior-generall,</hi> the <hi>Serieant-maiors</hi> of Regiments and to their <hi>Quarter-maſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is in the power of his Office alſo (after the Armie is incamped) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken a view of all the Poſts and Guards of the Campe, to appoint all the Regiments, in what manner they ſhall place their <hi>Corps de Guards,</hi> the <hi>Scouts</hi> &amp; <hi>Sentinels,</hi> ſo as no man may paſſe either in or out; but to be continually vpon their diſcouery, and likewiſe to prouide for all other Reparations, Fortifications and Srengths which are to be made for the ſafetie of the whole Armie. And as thus in the conſtant ſetling of the<pb n="192" facs="tcp:14641:102"/>Armie, ſo in the Marching and remouing thereof, the Lord <hi>Marſhall</hi> is to haue an eſpeciall regard to his ſtrength and abilitie to encounter with the Enemie, &amp; whether it be meete to enter into the face of Battell or no, or whether the times be ripe for matters of execution or elſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre and keepe of all occaſions of encounters; In which if he find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the weaker; Hee ſhall then order his Marches through Rockie Mountanous, and as ill acceſſible places as he can finde out, thereby to adde a naturall ſtrength to his Armie ſo as the Enemie may in no wiſe aſſault him, and ſtill to haue the lighter ſort of Horſemen to March ſo neare vnto the Enemie that continually vpon euery alteration hee may haue a ſpeedy notice of any particuler preparation; but if the neceſſitie of the march be through Champains &amp; Plaines where the nature of the ground affoardeth no aſſiſtance, then the Lord <hi>Marſhall</hi> muſt by all poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique deuiſes make his Caualrie or Horſe Armie, appeare ſo great and innumerable as is poſſible, which (being the greateſt executioners in ſuch Victories) will not a little amaze and diſtract the Enemie in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; and ſo of the contrary part reputing himſelfe the ſtronger, he is to obſerue all aduantages, and by the diſcouerie of his Scouts to take oportunitie and to charge at the beſt aduantage.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as in <hi>Encamping</hi> and <hi>Marching,</hi> ſo he is to hold eſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards in the remouing of the Campe, whether it be by night or day, In which as the day remoue is audacious and bold without any reſpect of ceremonie; ſo muſt the night Remoue be full of <hi>Policie, Silence</hi> and great <hi>Diligence,</hi> and the march or good array to be held with all care and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, for this manner of Remoue is but one haire difference from flight, and therefore it requireth all the skill and art of the
<hi>Marſhall,</hi> and all the care and obedience that can be required in the Souldier; for it is a Rule in Martiall Diſcipline, that no Remoue by night can be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecure, and then being done without ſecuritie it muſt needs Inferre neceſſitie, and that neceſsitie requireth all the ſtrength which can bee comprehended either in Art or Valour.</p>
               <p>Into a world of other accourrens I could runne in this vnlimited Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but I imagine I haue already touched the moſt materiall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that ſhall applie the ſtrength of his endeauours to performe as much as is already deliuered, though he cannot aſſcence to the higheſt Spheare in euery curious apprehenſion (yet beleeue it) he ſhall reſt in ſuch an excellent middle (which indeed is the beſt) path, that none can or ſhall receiue more ſcorne then thoſe which dare to be his Scorners.</p>

               <p>This man, howſoeuer the Generall hath a great power in his nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet his election ought to be from the Prince himſelfe, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of his Councell of State: for as he is a yoke-fellow and compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Generall, ſo he is the ſeruant of his Country, and when they are poiz'd together, the greater dutie muſt rob him of the much leſſer obſeruation: wherefore it is requiſite this man be excellent and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht in euery perfection whatſoeuer, as that of <hi>Religion, Wiſedome, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, Policy, Grauitie, Secreſie, Counſell, Modeſtie, Temperance, Valour, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie, Care, Vigilance, Constancie, Liberality,</hi> and <hi>Reſolution:</hi> for if but any one of theſe haue a withered leafe, howeuer the Tree may flouriſh, yet ſtill there will bee in euery conſtant Gazer ſome one or other marke of Imputation.</p>
               <p>The moſt materiall parts of his Office conſiſteth in Counſels, and the debatements of all ſerious deſignes, when they are iudicially cald vpon, and ſo argued to the vttermoſt benefit and ſtrength of the Army, as alſo in vttering (to the Armie) all the directions and commandements which at any time proceed from the Generall; for in truth the ſubſtance of his place cannot bee intituled by any more worthy name, then to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Eccho</hi> or voice of the Generall; for he is to all the great Officers of the Armie the Interpreter of whatſoeuer the Generall intendeth, and therfore it is exceeding neceſſary that he which commandeth in ſo high a place, ſhould be as highly renowned for all high and excellent vertues, which may adorne either his mind or knowledge, and bee (as it were) a Lanthorne or bright lampe, by which euery man might haue a cleare and ſhining Light, to guide and direct him in the ſwift Race and<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14641:103"/>Cariere to all Noble and Praiſe-worthie Attchieuements.</p>
               <p>In this mans power (vnder the ſufferage of the Generall) is the election of many Captaines, and other great places, which according to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie of his owne Goodneſſe will euer bee more ſingular and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table both for the Prince and Armie: for a good man will euer ſtudie to abound in good men, when the euill and vicious ſtriue ſtill to bee atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by men of their owne nature and diſpoſition; and the good Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bringeth forth the good Souldier, but the good Souldier, the noble, happy, and famous actions. Theſe premiſes duly conſidered, it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this our <hi>Lieutenant Generall</hi> for his experience and inward know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be no Scholler, but a Maſter in the Art of Warre, to be redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and valiant in the extremitie of all Attempts, yet without Furie or Raſhneſſe; to be full of graue and admired authoritie, by which the very glimpſe or ſhadow of his countenance may bee able to ſtrike an awefull reuerence into the hearts and mindes of all that ſhall behold him: and laſtly, he muſt be the delight and fauourite of <hi>Fortune,</hi> that all the actions and attempts which he ſhall take in hand, may concurre and follow with all bleſſed ſucceſſe, and moſt happy proceedings: for thus the old <hi>Romans</hi> choſe ſtill their <hi>Lieutenants,</hi> and thus they went foorth armed with great experience; and thus they euer returned home adorned with ſtately and famous Triumphs.</p>
               <p>Againe, in this man theſe excellencies are to be required more then in any other: for be he of which ſort of Lieutenants (abſolute) a man ſhall pleaſe to elect, yet on him the greateſt burthen of affaires muſt euer depend: for notwithſtanding Kings and Princes are commonly pleaſed to be preſent with their Armies themſelues in perſon, yet if they haue not that large benefit of Experience which is requiſite in ſuch needfull and potent occaſions, yet carrying with them <hi>Lieutenants-Generals</hi> of graue, ancient, and renowned experience, who as true ſeruants to their King, and kind Fathers to their Countries, are able to manage and paſſe through all the doubtfull encounters depending vpon the Warres, there is no feare but all things will ſucceed well, and the temper of his ſound and more abler Iudgement will bring to his Countrey many famous and happy Conqueſts, and to his King a new name of power and authoritie, by which hee ſhall be admired and feared of all Nations, and all people, which dare to oppoſe or trie the effects of his Fortunes.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Lieutenant-generall</hi> of ours, as hee muſt haue true Magnanimitie and Martiall valour, carefully reſpecting euery Action belonging to the warres, ſo he is to haue alſo a ſingular induſtrie to put euery thing in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and an agile and quicke readineſſe, prompt to effect and bring euery thing to paſſe; beſides a Conſtancy and true Fortitude of minde to paſſe through all hazardous dangers, and by the diſcourſe of Reaſon to lay euen and ſmooth thoſe rough and thornie wayes, which either ſtriue to interpoſe his deſignes, or elſe as it were (againſt all likelihood) to thruſt in and ſtand prepared (with the Bug-beare ſhaddow of a little oddes) to iuſtle or throw downe his Fortunes; and hence it is neceſſary that this<pb n="196" facs="tcp:14641:104"/>great and powerfull Officer haue his mind fortified and enriched with all the Stratagems and Policies of Warre, by the vſe and imployment whereof he ſhall giue a greater teſtimonie of his Wiſedome and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience then of any other practiſe whatſoeuer: for to what purpoſe were experience, if the fruit thereof doe not appeare and ſhine in his actions, wherefore it is the ſtrength of this mans dutie, to put all things in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution with great care, diligence and vigilance; and by a naturall and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret inſtinct to find out and re-acknowledge the natures, diſpoſitions and inclinations of all the enemies Commaunders, and to finde which are Bold, which Raſh, which Fearefull, which Wiſe, and which Inconſiderat, that by making his applications ſutable to their imperfections, hee may attaine to the ends of his purpoſes with much greater eaſe, &amp; many times with much leſſe loſſe or bloody effuſion. A world of other obſeruations are required in this great mans Office; but in as much as they are in as neere a linke of alliance to the abſolute <hi>Generall</hi> himſelfe, I will heere knit vp this Epiſtle, and referre the reſt as a binding Fillet, with which to circle and gird together the next following, and laſt conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Epiſtle.</p>

               <p>Being come to the laſt Confines of this Militarie diſcourſe, I am in this place to handle the particuler duties and vertues of an abſolute <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> or the only one great and entier Commander ouer an Armie Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, wherein is to be vnderſtood that the name or title of
<hi>Generall</hi> (as it is reſpectiuely in it ſelfe) is to be taken diuers and ſundry waies, for ſome are abſolute and without ſeconds, as were the foure principall monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the world, to wit, the

                  <hi>Roman,</hi> ſome not altogether ſo abſolute, yet depending vpon one and the ſame authoritie; as for example, <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> who notwithſtanding he was but at firſt a ſeruant to the Seuant, yet aſpiring to the height of his ambition, the greateſt ſtile that hee affected was but to be <hi>Imperater</hi> (which ſignifieth a
<hi>Generall</hi>) and the moſt glorious Title (at this day) which any Prince can attaine is but <hi>Generall,</hi> yet this great Diamond is ſtill more Glorious and Sparkling, according to the Wealth and Arte in the ſetting; for an abſolute Soueraigne being made <hi>Generall</hi> ouer many Princes and many Nations, and going to a holy Warre againſt the enemies of God and ſinceare Religion, he is eſteemed the beſt and moſt renowned
<hi>Generall</hi> of all others; Next him is the abſolute King which holdeth dependance on none, but leadeth forth his owne Battels and people, to defend his Rights againſt Rebels; Intruding Iniurers or vnlawfull Vſurpers, then the Heires apparent vnto abſolute Kings, as our Blacke Prince,
<hi>Philip</hi> Dolphin of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> ſonne to
<hi>Charles</hi> the fift of <hi>Spaine,</hi> or the like; and laſtly lawfull
<hi>Generals</hi> made by abſolute Princes, as the Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Guyſe</hi> in
<hi>France, Pembroke, Suſſex, Leiceſter,</hi> and <hi>Eſsex</hi> in
<hi>England;</hi> and of theſe Generals there are alſo a diuers kinde, grounding the greatnes of their places from the greatneſſe of their Commiſſions; being Stiled, ſome by the name of Generals (as our
<hi>Leiceſter</hi> was in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi>) ſome
<hi>Liuetenants</hi> without the addition of <hi>Generall</hi> (as the Earle of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> was in <hi>Ireland</hi>) and ſome
<hi>Liuetenant-Generals</hi> as the Earle of <hi>Ormund</hi> was in the ſame Kingdome, the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> and diuers others, for it is a Rule amongſt Princes to qualifie theſe Titles according as either Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Iealouſies ſhal guid them: nay, ſometimes to Ioyne two Generals in one Commiſion, as <hi>Norris</hi> &amp; <hi>Drake</hi> into <hi>Portingall,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Nottingham</hi> into
<hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the vertues which are to be acquired in the breſt of this vnlimited Commander, howeuer ſome would ſeeke to bring them into a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable number, yet I affirme that queſtionleſſe he ought to haue All without limitation, no vertue excepted, and the vices which hee muſt ſhunne, ſhould likewiſe be All, and no vice accepted; this is hee which ought to be loued and obeyed at home, and redoubted and admired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: He ought to gouerne the courages of the greateſt, and the wills of the meaneſt. In matters that are declyning and deſperat, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy ought to be Inuincible, and his valour ſo firme that with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hee might ſtricke dead the hearts of his enemies, and make the very weapons drop out of the hand of the moſt reſolued oppoſers: it is he that ought to be darling of <hi>Fortune,</hi> and to whom <hi>Chance</hi> ſhould offer as a Sacrifice both Townes, Caſtles and Prouinces, as if they had beene taken in Nettes and throwne at his feete as lawfull Tributs, and yet not to imagine that this Body yeelded a greater ſhaddow after, then before his Victories, he muſt not robbe the Gods of their heads, to fixe them on his owne Statues, but like the Sunne, ſhine indifferently to all men, only appeare terrible and ſcortch the proud, raſh and ouer curious<pb n="199" facs="tcp:14641:105"/>Gazers; his Inclination as it muſt only bend to Armes, yet it muſt not looke awry from learning: he muſt inure his body to trauell, and feede his mind with paine &amp; pleaſure at one inſtant, &amp; howſoeuer <hi>Fortune</hi> at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time ſhall dart aduerſe accidents againſt him, yet muſt his reſolution maintaine ſo ſtrong a Guard about him, that ſhe may confeſſe his ſpirit greater then her violence, and his Wiſdome beyond the Stratagems of her ſeueareſt deſignes; he muſt haue Wiſdome to maintaine the Flowre of his vertue that it wither not before it haue brought forth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected fruits, and Care to keepe that <hi>Oliue</hi> branch euer greene which he ſhall purchaſe with the price of Blood, hazard of his life, and the loſſe of the goodlieſt and moſt flouriſhing yeares of his age: he ought to bee a <hi>Dauid</hi> in valour, a <hi>Solomon</hi> in wiſdome, and an <hi>Ezekias</hi> in zeale, making the world know what a great Iudgement can doe in a great Fortune, a great modeſtie in a great power, and a victorious arme in a renowned Triumph. To be briefe, this <hi>Generall</hi> is he, which ought to be a Godly man, a Good man, Great, Mercifull, Wiſe, Happy, moſt Honor'd, and moſt Worthy, which howſoeuer ſome may imagine to be a man ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner found in <hi>Eutopia,</hi> then any of our owne diſcouered Kingdomes, yet doubtleſſe many ſuch there are, and at leaſt ſo neare as can be, ſuch a man for this place ought euer to be elected.</p>
               <p>Touching the power of his Commandment, let it ſuffice me briefely to ſay that as he commands all; ſo the commandments which belong vnto all, are truely his, and he vnto the whole Armie muſt be the cheife and principall Moouer. Touching his Skill and Gouerment, in direction, in preuention, and in Marſhall Diſcipline, it ought to be ſo Illuſtrate and Shining, and ſo able to inchant with the felicities of his Fortunes, that not only his owne people, but all that farre or neere ſtood to gaze on his proceedings (how euer the wind blow vncertainly, or his courſe ſeeme doubtfull) yet with all willingneſſe might be proud to Imbarque them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in that veſſell, whoſe Pilot in gouerning the Helme was ſo aboue wonder, that euen the Seas (as a ſecond <hi>Neptune</hi>) ſeemd euer to obey him. And hence it appeares that hee ought to bee a Souldier euen from his Cradle, running through, or at leaſt reſpecting euery place and diſtinction of Office from the loweſt <hi>Sentinell,</hi> to the laſt great place of his preſent abiding, and that not in one kind, but in both alſo, Horſe and Foote, making vp (as it were) one ſinguler Arte with both their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and coupling together euery Nerue ſo with Studie and Obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, that all things may appeare eaſie and within the leuell of his Conqueſt; to this end his power muſt be abſolute and vnreſtrained, that flying with vnpinion'd wings it may ſeeme to be hid within the Skie of the greateſt Actions: In which way nothing can proſper him ſo much as
<hi>Pietie</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> for fearing God, it will not only pull vpon him a bleſſing, but adminiſter to his people noble examples.</p>
               <p>His Birth (howeuer <hi>Plato</hi> be differing in opinion, fearing leaſt the regard of Blood ſhould drownd the regard of vertue) ought to be No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for the great Spirit neuer declines but when it turnes backe on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,<pb n="200" facs="tcp:14641:106"/>it is they and only they which climbe by ſure or ſafe Stayres; Lower Fortunes when they riſe commonly either Iumpe and bound vp too ſuddenly, or ſtride and climbe ſo vnaduiſedly, that danger tripping at their heeles, ſhame often thruſtes them downe with a thouſand diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but if they get vp by a true and direct way, then they ennoble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; nor doth Honor loſe any grace when hee placeth Merit aboue him. This Officer would be of ripe and vnderſtanding yeares, for youth is traueling, but hath not attained to the iourney of experience, and age (how able ſoeuer it compound the minde) yet it ſtill muſt lodge in a Weake and Impotent body. His features and proportion ought to bee comely and delightfull, for models are better and with more delight taken from faire Structures, then Ruinous buildings; and his Speach would be gracefull, pleaſant and ſuccinc't, for in the warres it is a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous charme, and accounted the moſt wholeſomeſt Inchantment.</p>
               <p>To conclude, he ought to haue a principall regard of his owne ſafetie; for Generals when too freely they thruſt themſelues into dangers, are not careleſſe of their owne but of the health of the Armie, and the treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe is made againſt the publique, when any raſhneſſe hales the priuate into danger; let him therefore only outbraue danger not wooe it, let him with a bold for head and face fired with Courage, a heart diſcreete, and a minde that can preuent what Fortune dare to threaten, not run into, but reſiſt hazards; ſo ſhall he excell in good Fortunes and the world ſhall confeſſe that nothing he attempts, but is aſſiſted with Glory, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetie, Iudgement and Bouldneſſe.</p>
